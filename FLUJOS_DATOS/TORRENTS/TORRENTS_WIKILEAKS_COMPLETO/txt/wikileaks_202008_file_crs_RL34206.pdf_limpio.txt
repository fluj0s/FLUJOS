grants for one year through fy2009 tanf is best known as the funding sour ce for welfare benefits for lowincome families with children in 2006 19 million families per month received tanf cash welfare down from the historical high of five million families r eceiving cash welfare in the mid1990s in 2006 less than three in ten poor children were in families that received tanf cash welfare however t anf funds wide range of nonwelfare benefits and services for needy familie s with children in fy2006 spending on activities related to traditi onal cash welfare accounted for little more than half of total tanf funding while other nonwelfare activ ities accounted for the remainder though cash welfare is shrinking part of what tanf funds many of the issues congress might consider in the 110th congress beside supplemental grants focus on families receiving cash welfare particularly the work pa rticipation standards that apply to these families the dra made changes that require states to either increase participation among families receiving cash welfare in work or job preparation activities or reduce their welfare caseloads to meet these numerical performance standards the dra also required the partment of health and human services hhs to issue rules regulations defining what specific activities count toward the participation standards hhs final regulations publis hed on february 5 2008 allow states to count participation in fou ryear college degree program toward the participation standards nd provide for limited counting of rehabilitative activities however the regulations also limit countin g activities such as dult basic education abe pursuing general educational development ged credential and english as second language courses generally requiring them to be counted only in conjunction with activities more closely related to work in terms of nonwelfare spending from tanf congress might consider proposals left over from tanf reauthoriza tion proposals but not included in dra to loosen some rules for nonwelfare spending congress might also consider improving the information available on how tanf funds are used for nonwelfare benefits and services si nce relatively little is known about this half of tanf funding additionally legisla tion that affects foster care child welfare services for abused and neglected children and child care funding would have an effect on tanf since large amounts of tanf nonwel fare dollars are used to supplement dedicated federal and state funding for th programs this report will be updated as legislative events

families tanf is best known as funding source for cash welfar for lowincome families with children however the block grant also funds wi range of benefits and services for economically disadvantaged families it so funds activities to help achieve the goals of reducing outofwedlock pregnanc ies and raising children in twoparent families tanf was created in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 with the funding originally slated to expire at the end of fiscal year fy 2002 congress debated reauthorization of the block grant during the 107th through the 109th congresses1 comprehensive legislation to reauthorize and revise tanf did not pass during this period and the program operated on the basis of series of temporary extensions2 the deficit reduction ac t of 2005 dra pl 109171

and how to exte nd tanf supplemental grants which go to 17 states in the south and west on the basis of low historic levels of welfare funding and high population growth be yond september 30 2008 is the only must do task related to tanf in the 110th congress however congress might examinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs2 3 large body of literature that attempted to empirically estimate the impact of welfare on work effort and family structure developed prior to the 1990s this literature is reviewed in moffitt robert incentive effects of the us welfare system journal of economic literature vol 20 1 march 1992 pp 161 the literature review concluded that the available empirical evidence at the time show ed that welfare reduced labor supply work effort and weakly affected family structure however the magnitude of these effects indicated that the effect of we lfare was not large enough to fully explain the trends in work effort for single mothers or family structurethe impact of dras provisions related to tanf work participation standards for welfare recipients additionally in light of renewed interest in issues related to poverty and disadvantaged familie s with children interest might be raised in the flexibility states have to use tanf f unds for wide range of nonwelfare activities use of the term welfare in this report this report makes distinction between w elfare and nonwelfare spending within tanf the purpose of this distinction is to emphasize that tanf funds wide range of activities that go well beyond what is traditionally thought of as welfare and related administrative and work program costs in this report the nontechnical term tanf welfare is used to denote what is technically referred to within tanf as assistance tanfs implementing regulations define assistance as payments to families to meet ongoing basic needs such as food clothing shelter utilitie s household goods and other personal expenses this generally conforms to wh at most people call welfare there are broader uses of the term welfare which may include most benefits and services paid on the basis of financial need however in this report the term welfare is used in narrow sense nonwelfare is used to describe activities such as tanffunded work supports such as child care and transportation aid t anffunded refundable tax credits and tanf activities related to family formation issues in technical terms from tanfs implementing regulations these types of activities are given the label of nonassistance background and context tanf is the block grant created in the 1996 welfare reform law that replaced the new deal program of aid to families with dependent children afdc afdc provided monthly cash welfare benefits to needy families with children with most of these families headed by single mothers concerns that afdc helped create disadvantage by discouraging work and breaking up families dominated welfare reform debates from 1970 onward culmina ting in the 1996 welfare reform law3 some of the most visible policies of the 1996 welfare reform law are tanf work requirements for welfare reci pients time limits on the receipt of welfare and the end of federal entitlement to welfare for needy families with childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs3 4 for more detail on cash welfare benefit amounts under tanf see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy

vary widely among the states in january 2005 the monthly cash benefit in california was 723 for family of three4 the california benefit amount is high relative to many other states though even that benefit is only fraction 54 of povert ylevel income in alabama family of three received 215 per month 16 of povertylevel income table 1 shows selected economic and social indicators for 1995 2000 and 2006 as shown the cash welfare caseloa d plummeted from nearly 5 million to 19 million families over this period most of that caseload decline occurred from 1995 to 2000 though recently the cash welfare cas eload has fallen again the number of children in families receiving cash we lfare fell from 91 million to 35 million from 1995 to 2006 work among single moth ers who head most welfare families increased from 1995 to 2000 with some s lippage in the 20002006 period however despite the decline in receipt of cash welfare and increase in work among single mothers improvements in other social and economic indicator s have been less dramatic the child poverty rate di d fall from 1995 to 2000 but the 2006 rate of 174 is higher than in 2000 there remained 128 million children living in families with incomes below the poverty thre shold in 2006 further the percentage of babies born outofwedlock in 2006 was 389 an alltime high table 1 welfare receipt economic and social indicators for

the total number of poor persons under age 18 for the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs4 cash welfare reaches far fewer disadvantaged children than it did prior to welfare reform the ratio of the average monthly number of children in families receiving cash welfare to the total number of children in poverty declined from about six out of ten in 1995 to less than three out of ten in 2006 tanf is not just welfare program the 1996 law granted states permission to use funds for wide range of benefits services and activitie s to address some of the social and economic ills afflicting disadvantaged families with children states may use their funds in any manner reas onably calculated to further tanfs purpose which is to provide states with the flexibility to achieve four goals set in statute 1 provide assistance to needy families so that children may live in their own homes or in the homes of relatives 2 end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting work job preparation and marriage 3 reduce the incidence of out ofwedlock pregnancies and 4 promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families given the fixed funding of the tanf block grant states are able to use the savings from the welfare caseload declin to fund other nonwelfare benefits services and activities to tal funding in the tanf system comprises both the federal block grant to states and state s own funds spent to meet maintenance of effort moe requirement figure 1 shows the uses of tanf and moe funds in fy2006 it shows that the categories typi cally associated with traditional cash welfare program cash benefits administrative costs and work activities accounted for only little more than half of total tanf funds thus tanf has the potential to make an impact on

summary of the dra provisions affecting tanf for more detail please see crs report rs22369 tanf child care marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood prov isions of the deficit reduction act by gene falk extension of funding the dra extended most tanf funding through fy2010 however tanf supplemental grants discussed in some detail below were extended only through fy2008 therefore the 110th congress may consider whether to further extend these grants additionally the dra eliminated two tanf bonus funds the first bonus 200 million per year was for states that achieved high performance on measures relating to achieving tanf goals the second 100 million per year was for states that reduced outofwedlock birth ra tios without increasing abortions work participation standards and verifying work participation the 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states welfare caseload states that fail these participation standards could be financially penalized by reduction in their block grants the tanf work participation standards are numerical standards computed in the aggregate for states cash welfare caseload the participation standards are 50 for all families and 90 for the twoparent portion of its cash welfare caseload these standards may be met either by engaging welfare adult and teen parents in specified work and job preparation activities or through reductions in the tanf cash welfare caseload revision to the caseload reduction credit the 1996 welfare reform law provided states with credit for cas eload reduction that occurred from fy1995 the caseload reduction credit provided state with one percentage point reduction in its participation standards for each percent decline in its tanf cash welfare caseload from fy1995 the large caseload d eclines that occurred subsequent tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs7 6 us government accountability office welfare reform hhs should exercise oversight to help ensure tanf work participation is measured consistently across states gao05 821 august 2005fy1995 meant that most states had large reductions in the standards they were required to meet for many states the effective after credit participation standard was reduced to 0 the dra revised the caseload reduction cred it so that states will receive credit only for future welfare caseload reduction be ginning in fy2007 states receive credit for caseload reductions measured from fy2005 forward the effect of this change is much smaller caseload reducti on credits for fy2007 and higher effective after credit participation standards like the prio r law caseload reduction credit states are not given credit for caseload declines estimated to come from policy changes that restrict eligibility for welfare benefits counting families in separate state programs under the 1996 welfare reform law states could provide welf are to families using state moe funds and not count those families when determining whethe r the state met its work participation standard states could designate fa milies receiving welfare from moe funds as being assisted by separate state programs outside of the tanf program this effectively exempted the family from tanfs work participation standards the most common use of separate state prog rams was to house states twoparent welfare caseload and avoid the 90 partic ipation standard but states also used separate state programs for other popula tions such as college students and the disabled the dra requires beginning in fy2007 that states count families r eceiving cash welfare in separate state programs when determining work participation rates this effectively ends the exemption from tanf work participation standards for families placed in separa state programs definitions of work activi ties and work verification before the dra the operational details of state work programs were generally left to the states federal law lists 12 categorie s of activities that count toward the participation standards but regulations promulgated during the clinton administration from the department of health and human services hhs explicitly allowed states to define the specific activities counted in these categor ies hhs also left to states how work participation would be verified ie how to deter mine whether recipient scheduled to be in an activity actually performed that activity the government accountability office gao in 2005 report found that the lack of further definition for what count s as work led to widerange of state practices particularly with respect to education and rehabilitative activities6 gao concluded that this led to an inconsiste nt measurement of work across states and recommended that hhs regulate what c ounts as work the dra required hhs to issue regulations providing consistent definition of work activities and describing procedures for states to verify work ac tivity these regulations were issued in interim form on june 29 2006 then revised and published in final form on februaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs8 7 for detailed discussion of the differences between the interim and final regulations see crs memorandum

research and demonstration projects to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood the marriage promotion grants are generally for nonwelfare services and not necessarily restricted to lowincome families such as advertising campaigns education in hi gh schools on the value of marriage and education in social skills the respons ible fatherhood gran ts attempt to reach noncustodial parents with education in s ocial skills as well as job training legislative issues in the 110th congress related to tanf funding the dra extended the bulk of federa l tanf and moe funding through fy2010 however dra continued suppl emental grants only thr ough fy2008 making decision on their extension beyond then the business of the 110th congress unless congress acts to extend supplemental grants the fy2009 tanf grant awards beginning october 1 2008 would be reduced for the 17 st ates that receive supplemental grants in light of the potential for an economic slump 110th congress might also review tanfs contingenc provisions for financing unanticipated spending increases because of recession supplemental grants the bulk of federal funding for tanf is in fixed basic block grant with its amount determined by the amount of fundi ng state received under pre1996 welfare and related programs all state funding under the tanf moe is also determined by the historical level of welfare spending by the state each states basic grant and moe levels has been frozen since fy1997 it is neither adjusted for inflation nor for changing circumstances population or t anf cash welfare caseload thus tanf funding rules have effectiv ely locked in historical levels of funding which reflected the pre1996 welf are policies of states during the welfare reform debate of the mid1990s concerns were raised that the fixed funding based on historical spe nding patterns disadvantaged two sets of states 1 those that paid relatively low welfare benefits and consequently had low federal grants relative to poverty in the st ate and 2 high population growth stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs9 the supplemental grants were added to t anf to target additional funds to such states seventeen states qualify for supplemental grants from fy1998 through fy2001 supplemental grants grew each year until they reached 319 million they have been frozen at that level since the dra extended supplemental

child per year in arkansas is 23 of the national average the arkansas supplemental grant adds 38 pe r year per poor child raising its funding to 518 per year per poor child the 518 is 25 of the national average additionally not all states with low vels of funding per poor child receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs10 supplemental grants some were excluded because their population growth was less than the national average oneyear extension of supplemental gran ts through fy2009 is included in hr 6331 medicare bill president bush vetoed the bill because of certain medicare provisions but congress overrode the veto on july 15 2008 extension of supplemental grants through fy2010 when other tanf grants expire will require further action by congress earlier in 2008 senator ro ckefeller introduced s 2820 which would both extend and expand supplemental grants s 2820 would fund supplemental grants through fy2010 and provide add itional grants for all states with below average total federal and state tanf resources per poor child tanf recession funds tanfs fixed block grant led to concerns that funding might be insufficient in the event of recession therefore th 1996 welfare reform law included three provisions intended to allow states to suppl ement their annual block grant in the case of recession state may reserve or save funds during pe riods of economic growth to be used to pay for any increased costs associated with recession draw from continge ncy fund if it meets criteria of economic need expends extra state funds to reach level of 100 of fy1994 state spending and also expends ex tra state funds to match federal contingency funds and obtain interestbearing loans from th federal government that would have to be repaid tanf was only tested by one r ecession the relatively shallow 2001 recession however during and after th at recession employment among single mothers slumped some and child poverty in creased on national level the cash welfare caseload did not respond as it remain ed relatively constant during the period 2001 to 2004 when child poverty increased reserve funds unspent tanf funds have some times been seen not as reserves to save in the case of recession but as an indicator of lack of need the bush administrations 2002 welfare reaut horization proposal and all except one of the comprehensive reauthorization bills considered during 20022005 allowed states to designate either some or all of thei r unspent monies as contingency reserve funds tanf contingency fund state drew funds from the tanf contingency fund during or immediately after the 2001 r ecession there were two major reasons states failed to draw down c ontingency funds during rece ssion first states would have had to increase spending from their ow n funds before they could qualify for the first matching contingency do llar second many states fa iled to meet the criteria of economic need based on high and increas ing unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads during the recession httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs11 8 this is in addition to funds drawn fro m the contingency fund in fy2005 and fy2006 to aid evacuee victims of hurricane katrina under pl 10968ironically few states drew upon contingency funds in 2005 and 20068 well after the 2001 recession had ended they qualified based on high food stamp caseloads the 1996 law provided that state would be considered economically needy for contingency funds if states food stamp caseload was 10 higher than its adjusted caseload during the corresponding period in fy1994 or fy1995 fy1994 and fy1995 are adjusted downward for immigra nts made ineligible for food stamps by the 1996 welfare reform law f ood stamp caseloads unlike cash welfare caseloads did increase with the 2001 recession and have remained historically high the food stamp contingency fund trigger is also expressed in terms of number of participants rather than rate of receipt in state population growth over the 12 or 13year period means that the number of participants in state can be higher than in the base years even if the rate at which people in the state receive food stamps declined the 2002 bush administration welfare reauthorization proposal and all comprehensive reauthorization bills c onsidered during the 20022005 period would have made some changes to the tingency fund reauthorization proposals emanating from the senate finance committ ee would have made more farreaching changes to the contingency fund th ey would have eliminated matching requirements and made the unemployment and food stamp criteria for qualifying for contingency funds more sensitiv to recent economic changes tanf loan fund tanf includes loan fund so that states running short of tanf grants could borrow funds from the federal government these loans would have to be repaid with interest aside from loans to states affected by hurricane katrina that were forgiven st ate has drawn loan from the fund the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthor ization proposal and all comprehensive reauthorization proposals considered during 20022005 would have eliminated the loan fund however dra extended the tanf loan fund through fy2010 potential legislative issues for the 110th congress related to families receiving welfare though welfare now accounts for only little more than half of all tanf and moe funding most issues the 110th congress might consider other than financing issues relate to families recei ving welfare specifically these issues relate to the laws requirement that sp ecified percentage of cash welfare families in each state participate in work or related activities dras changes to the caseload reduction credit require states to either 1 raise the share of families on the welfare roles working or engaged in job preparation activities or 2 reduce the cash welfare caseload although much attention has been paid to the required increase in participation standard s and the impact of drarequire d regulations specifying the operational details of state work prog rams the cash welfare caseload has beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs12 declining at an accelerating rate over the most recent 12month period for which data are available the tanfmoe cash welfare caseload declined by 10 meeting tanf work participation standards the change in the caseload reduction credit beginning in fy2007 providing credit only for caseload reduction from fy 2005 means that many states had to either quickly raise participation in activities or reduce their caseloads to meet tanfs work participation standards s imultaneously states had to adjust to new rules in the form of regulations from hhs required by the dra for what specific activities count toward the participa tion standards and how participation is supervised and verified however couple of points might he lp put issues regarding tanf work participation standards in perspective first althoug h the tanf work participation standard rules undoubtedly influence the design of state work requirements states themselves still determine the requirements that apply to individuals states are free to determine that some families may be exempt from participating and can determine that some individuals in these famili may participate in activities that are not countable toward the federal standards second these tanf work participation rules affect rela tively small number of families each month as discussed bove while cash welfare caseloads have declined markedly within the cash welfare caseload the number

that many states are in jeopardy of failing the twoparent standard failure to meet the twoparent participation standard by itself is likely to result in fairly small penalty to the states under hhs regulations the maximum penalty for failure to meet the twoparent particip ation standard would be prorated based on the share of the cash welfare caseload that consists of twoparent families however this would not be the case if state failed both the allfamily and twoparent participation standards the rules penalize state more heavily if they fail both standards than if they fa il one of the two standards14 additionally the high two parent participation sta ndard potentially encourages states to calculate ways to game tanf rules through june 2007 12 states had dropped serving twoparent fa

controversy over the effectiveness of different approaches to getting welfare recipients off the rolls and into jobs w orkfirst approach advocates often point to research conducted in the 1990s that found that when the workfirst and education focused programs were directly compar ed the longterm impact of education focused programs on increasing earning s and reducing welfare receipt was greater and sometimes smaller than programs that focus on job seeking and quick attachment to job15 additionally the impact of work first programs occurs faster however the evaluated programs with the largest increases in earnings and reductions in welfare tended to have st rong work message like the workfirst programs but provided some flexibility for education and training for example large impacts were attributed to prog ram operated in tland oregon during the 1990s that like other workfirst progra ms had job search as its most common activity however portland program recipients also often participated in education or in both job search and education during the two years following entry into the program more often than in other evaluated programs in portland job search and education

sometimes receive tanf payment while tanf payment is typically worth much less than foster care payment relative caregivers are nearly always eligible for tanf payment and may turn to it for financial support because they do not meet the eligibility requirements for federally supported foster care in particular those criteria provide that an foster family home where child is placed must meet state licensing requirements in order for the state to seek federal reimbursement of foster care maintenance payment many relatives cannot meet or do not wish to undergo state foster care licensing

eligibility or decreas the tanf cash welfare benefit amount further caseload decline discussions of the new tanf work partic ipation standards ve tended to focus on the need to increase the number of

responsible fatherhood though much of the controversy durin g the welfare reauthorization debate focused on cash welfare recipients and their work requirements major component of the bush administrati ons 2002 welfare reform proposals was to provide grants to promote healthy marriag these initiatives were nonwelfare initiatives education in social skills as we ll as campaigns in schools and in the media on the importance of marriage the dra included 150 million per year appropriation for competitive grants to promote healthy marriages and r esponsible fatherhood about 100 million per year of these funds are for researc h demonstrations and technical assistance related to promotion of hea lthy marriages hhs awarded fiveyear grants to variety of organizations from this appropriation29 this amount of funding is large relative to other available funds for research nd demonstrations under tanf tanf has 15 million appropriation for both state and federally initiated research projects hhs also receives an appropriation for research which was 57 million for fy2007 congress might conduct oversight to examine how these projects are likely to improve the research base from which programs

child welfare financing an issue overview by emilie stoltzfuschild care and child welfare financing as discussed above tanf supplements federal funding for both the child care block grant and the various federal progra ms that help fund foster care adoption assistance and child welfare services the supplement provided by tanf is fairly large in fy2005 total tanf and moe funding for child care totaled about 54 billion which reflected both transfers to the child care and development fund ccdf and expenditures within the tanf program at 19 of total tanf and moe funding child care is the second larg est category next to cash welfare within tanf expenditures on child welfare activities for example foster care and services for families with children who have been abused and neglected or are atrisk of abuse and neglect cannot be derived directly from tanfs financial reporting system the urban institute on the basis of survey of the states reported that in state fy2004 tanfs contribution to child welfare agency funding totaled 30 billion thus child care and child welfare servi ces together account for more than half at least 8 billion of the 13 billion of tanf and moe funding available for nonwelfare activities therefore legisl ation affecting either child care or child welfare financing could have an impact on how much funding is available for tanfs other activities legislation affecting child welfare f unding would also have an impact on tanf as discussed above legislation has been introduced that would allow nonparent relatives caring for children to be eligible for federal foster care payments some of these relatives currently rely on tanf cash welfare30 this change could transfer some cases out of tanf and onto the foster care rolls freeing up some tanf dollars other longstanding child we lfare financing issues if resolved could also affect the amount of tanf and moe funds used by the child welfare system31 conclusion the 110th congress might consider range of tanf issues number of them stem from policy changes made by congress in the dra these issues also touch on some that have been longdebated such as the role of education and training in helping recipients move from welfare to work and achieving selfsufficiency even absent scheduled reauthoriza tion of tanf this may be an opportune time to reconsider tanf issues and the role the block grant can play to help disadvantaged families with children the context that tanf operates in has changed considerably from the time of the welfare reform debates in the early and mid1990s the cash welfare caseload has d eclined substantially and incentives are in place for states to seek further caseload declines nonwelfare support for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34206crs29 working poor has increased both with t anffunded benefits nd services eg child care and from other programs eg earned income tax credit and state childrens health insurance program the nonwelfare part of tanf has the potential to help di sadvantaged families with children through new and innovative wa ys whether that is happening is an open question given the information gap on these activities
