cautiously optimistic about russian jewish community ref moscow 02696 classified by ambassador john beyrle for reason 14 d 1 c summary the ambassador met separately with xxxxx during the week of september 15 xxxxx probed for potential us sanctions against investors in south ossetia and abkhazia and flagged concern over irans nuclear program both xxxxx agreed that manifestations of antisemitism in russia had fallen in recent years but xxxxx attributed putins relatively projewish stance to his need to not appear antisemitic during his campaign against the oligarchs regarding the jewish community xxxxx praised the positive effects of russias explosion of wealth while xxxxx linked economic expansion to negative shift in the occupational and educational interests of the russian jewry both xxxxx added that immigration from israel to russia vastly exceeded russian emigration to israel but xxxxx noted the reduced israeli financial support because of the falling dollar end summary antisemitism muted compared to soviet era 2 c xxxxx told the ambassador on september 16 that antisemitism in russia has declined in recent years and that russian jews faced fewer problems today than in soviet times xxxxx noted that the chance for reversal of fortune for russian jews existed characterizing russia as country of extremes he drew an analogy to gorbachevs prohibition of alcohol and the russian penchant to drink excessively as manifestation of these extremes xxxxx more cautiously agreed that antisemitism was not widespread especially in russias political sphere as it had been in past years however he attributed this change in part to putins conscious desire to appear unbiased in his campaign against russias predominately jewish oligarchs xxxxx added that economic prosperity brought tolerance and reduced the need for scapegoats noting that russias newfound wealth softened principal grievance of russian society he also applauded the russian governments efforts to punish those that committed raciallymotivated crimes saying that the 16year imprisonment of aleksandr koptsov for stabbing 11 people in moscow synagogue in 2006 left an indelible impression on society xxxxx also explained the role of numerous jewish organizations in russia and eastern europe referred specifically to the increasing prominence of the russian jewish community in germany and he said that russian jews wql eventually assume leadership of the jewish community there political jockeying georgia iran 3 c xxxxx admitted that he did not have the same level of contact with the kremlin as xxxxx chief rabbi of russia berel lazar note along with chief rabbi of russia berel lazar xxxxx calling himself an old man he claimed to have little interest in attending official functions and he appreciated the fact that he was longer bothered by the ruling elite he singled out the kremlins disapproval of russian oligarch vladimir gusinsky xxxxx as the chief reason for his past and current political suffering 4 c xxxxx in his meeting probed for information about potential us crackdowns against any oligarchs for investing in south ossetia or abkhazia curious about the future funding for the jewish community he specifically mentioned diamond magnate lev levievs rumored financial problems stemming from some bad investments and added that the current financial crisis damaged the russian elite xxxxx expressed concern over iran noting to his recent travel to brussels for the european jewish congress ejc annual meeting chaired by ejc president and russian billionaire vyacheslav moshe kantor kantor called for strong legal multilateral measures against iran for their development of nuclear weapons program in may 2008 press conference then subsequently traveled to tehran for meetings according to xxxxx he spoke about kantors work on holocaust issues specifically drawing on kantors work with the government of poland on the 65th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz as well as his cooperation with the government of ukraine in 2006 on remembering the 65th anniversary of the executions at babi yar xxxxx estimated that kantor had dedicated approximately 3040 million dollars to his work in eastern europe but did not specifically say if kantor drew on his own funds for this purpose jewish community relations 5 c while xxxxx gave mixed assessment on the future of russias jewish community xxxxx saw russias economic growth as positive for the jewish middle class while naming the georgian and azeri jewish communities in moscow as strong and calling the entire jewish community more stable xxxxx criticized the motivations of russias jewish youth saying they longer strove for prestigious careers in science teaching or theology as in soviet times xxxxx placed importance on current youth projects pointing to the need for more robust jewish upbringing in contemporary society considering that many young jews pursued business careers xxxxx on the other hand saw russias newfound wealth as positive factor for the jewish community since it has enabled the formerly lower class citizens to reach middle class status community members have earned the ability to buy cars and real estate travel once year and even provide donations for community projects he also relayed the fact that the moscow jewish community had taken control of its financial situation longer relying on help from abroad 7 c while the number of jews in russia remained low the community retained strong support xxxxx could not give an exact number for russias jewish population estimating the communitys number at 500000 with only 1500 jews left in his birthplace of birobidzhan jewish autonomous district note 2008 international religious freedom report estimated russias jewish population at 250000 xxxxx blamed the decline of the jewish autonomous district on lack of leadership he tallied 112 jewish communities in russia and added that new synagogues had been built in petrogorsk tomsk tula and in the northern caucasus xxxxx told the ambassador that the congress of the jewish religious organizations and associations of russia keroor had over 100 communities in russia predominantly based in st petersburg moscow and the golden ring outside of moscow those communities outside of these three regions typically depended on financial support from moscow 8 c xxxxx for jewish museum failed to bear fruit while lazars museum of tolerance reftel received highlevel support from putin and luzhkov his past efforts to create nondenominational jewish museum never took off xxxxx saw the museum of tolerance as chabad project one that will present lazars perception of jewish history and culture and confirmed that leviev financed lazars project along with roman abramovich israel 9 c xxxxx indicated that jewish immigration from israel to russia greatly exceeded that of emigration from russia to israel xxxxx appeared impressed by the level of reverse immigration from israel to russia saying that only approximately 1000 russians emigrated to israel over the past year xxxxx impressions saying that approximately 2000 jews in the entire former soviet union moved to israel in the past year both regarded the figures as the product of russias growing stability and wealth adding greater depth on russianisraeli relations xxxxx blamed the falling dollar for the reduction of israeli support to the russian jewish educational system xxxxx lauded the recently signed visafree travel agreement between russia and israel since it would mean less work for him longer needing to help his community members receive visas beyrle
