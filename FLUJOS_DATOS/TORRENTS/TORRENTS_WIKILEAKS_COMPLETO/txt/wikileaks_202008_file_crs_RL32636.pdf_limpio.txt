incrementally through the mid and late 1990s and then accel erated markedly following the signing of bilateral trade agreement bta in 20001 one measure of the pace of the normalization of bilateral economic relations is the increase in trade flows which rose from about 200 million in 1994 to over 1 billion in 2000 to nearly 45 billion in 2003 the united states is now vietnams largest trading partner the resumption of us aid to vietnam has closely tracked the normalization of bilateral relations us assistance began as trickle in 1991 when around 1 million was spent for prosthetics for vietnamese war victims and increased to nearly 50 million in fiscal year fy 2004 covering broad range of programs moreover the level of assistance has more than doubled since fy2000 see table 1 for

large us aid programs in part because many countries in the regi on have graduated from economic aid future areas for possible expansion if usvietnam relations continue to deepen particularly in the

2005 in ruling that was widely publicized in vietnam in april 2005 th bush administration discontinued funding of grant to conduct research in vietna m on the possible relationship between agent orange and birth defects the justification for the decision was that the vietnamese ministry of health had not gi ven its approval for the study recent attempts to restrict aid in recent years congress has devoted considerable atten tion to vietnams human rights record vietnam is oneparty authoritarian state since at least the late 1990s the ruling vietnamese communist party vcp appears to have followed strategy of relaxing mo st restrictions on most fo rms of personal and religious expression while selectively repressing individuals and organizations that it deems threat to the partys monopoly on political power most prominently the government has cracked down harshly on protests against various government policies by certain ethnic minority groups particularly the montagnards in the countrys central highlands and the hm ong in the northwest highlands the government also has steppe d up repression of socalle d cyber dissidents who have criticized the government over the inte

be made by midmarch 2005 the vietnam human rights act hr 1587 in large measure due to vietnams crackdowns in the central high lands attempts were made in the 107th and 108th congresses to link us aid to the human rights situation in vietnam the most prominent example the vietnam human rights act hr 1587 in the 108th congress hr 2833 in the 107th proposed capping existing nonhumanitarian us assistance programs to the vietnamese government at fy2004 levels in hr 1587 if the president does not certify that vietnam is making substantial progress in human rights including religious freedom hr 1587 also would have authorized funds to promote democracy in vietnam and to overcome the jamming of radio free asia on july 19 2004 by vote of 32345 the house passed hr 1587 proponents of the measure argued that it w ould pressure the vi etnamese government to improve the countrys human rights situ ation attempts to include strippeddown versions of hr 1587 in the consolidat ed appropriations act 2005 hr 4818 did not succeed if enacted the immediate substantive impact of hr 1587 on us assistance would likely have been negligible becau the bill applied only to nonhumanitarian aid that is provided to the vietnamese government at present us non humanitarian assistance is given directly to the government of vietnam and only 50000 of such assistance is c ontemplated for the future for expanded international military education and training eimet english language courses for vietnamese military officers also the bill would have granted the president national interest waiver that would have allowed him to exempt any programs that are deemed to promote the goals of the act andor to be in the national interests of the united states furthermore most of the certification and reporting requireme nts in hr 1587 are already mandated albeit in more genera l fashion by provisions of other laws such as the international religious freedom act thus if it had been enacted the principal impact would likely have been symbolic critics argued that the bill could chill the warming of bilateral political and security ties that has been taking place slowly over the past several months in practical terms hr 1587 would have acted as an obstacle to initiating new militaryt omilitary assistance cooperation such as imet the vietnamese government strong ly

chinese who then became refugees in southeast asia the normalization pro cess since the early 1990s washington and hanoi gradually began to normalize relations in the early 1990s following vietnams withdrawal from cambodia and improvements in hanois cooperation on the issue of amer ican prisoners of war pows and missinginaction mia personnel in vietnam18 economic assistance was resumed in 1991

to orphans to amelio rate the effects of the war coinciding with these developmen ts in 1991 and 1992 the senate select committee on powmia affairs chaired by john kerry and vicechaired by bob smith conducted what many consid er the most extensive independent investigation of the powmia issu undertaken in early 1993 the co mmittee issued its report which concluded that there wa s compelling evidence that pows were alive after the us withdrawal from vi etnam and that although there was conspiracy in washington to cover up live pows the us government had seriously neglected and mismanaged the i ssue particularly in the 1970s the committees televised hearings played major role in defusing much of the passion that had surrounded the pow issue the us aid program in vietnam expa nded gradually through the 1990s in step with the acceleration of the normalization process in 1993 president bill clinton announced that the united states would longer oppose intern ational financial

its fi rst waiver from the requirements of the socalled jacksonvanik amendment contai ned in the trade act of 1974 title iv section 402 which prohibit the presid ent from normalizing commercial relations with selected socialist and formerly soci alist countries if they do not meet certain requirements regarding freedom of migration congressional resolution disapproving the waiver was defeated as have such resolutions disapproving the presidential waivers issued every year since all of these steps provoked considerab controversy in congress though opposition to normalization decreased incrementally throughout the 1990s following the signing of the bta in 2000 congress overwhe lmingly approved the agreement which paved the way for th two countries to extend normal trade relations ntr status on nonpermanent basi s to one another the signing of the bta marked the end to legal restrictions on virtually all commercial transactions and most forms of economic assistance to vietnam also in 2000 the clinton administration in an undated unpublishe d determination on national interest grounds exempted vietnam from the prohi bition on most forms of assistance to communist countries contained in secti on 620f of the foreign assistance act of 196121 vietnam and the united states gradually have been expanding their political and security ties although these have lagge d far behind the economic aspect of the relationship in 2003 and 2004 however vi etnams leadership appears to have decided to expand their countrys ties to the united states as indicated by the
