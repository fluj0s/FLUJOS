russia and us interests this report may be updated as events warrant related products include crs issue brief ib92089 russia updated regularly background1 the october 2003 arrest of mikhail khodorkovskiy purportedly russias richest person and other moves against his yukos oil firm among the worlds largest in terms of reserves have raised concerns among some us policymakers and analysts about the status of economic and political reforms in russia and repercussions for usrussia relations steppedup russian government moves against yukos became public in july 2003 with the reopening of supposedly resolved privatization fraud case and arrest of platon lebedev major yukos shareholder and chairman of its holding company menatep prosecutors also revisited other yukos cases many of which ostensibly had been settled or dropped and launched several raids of yukos and menatep offices the yukos probe heightened concerns among many of russias wealthiest businessmen the socalled oligarchs who benefitted greatly from the controversial privatization auctions of stateowned companies in the 1990s of widescale government reexamination of their personal fortunes corporate empires and private property rights in general several prominent businessmen had implored russian 1 sources for this report include the foreign broadcast information service fbis central eurasia daily report rferl

president vladimir putin to intervene with prosecutors to release lebedev and scale down the investigation but putin claimed that the rule of law demanded his noninvolvement then on october 25 2003 khodorkovskiy was arrested and charged with fraud embezzlement and evading personal and corporate taxes to purportedly protect the governments interest in collecting the taxes the prosecutor impounded 441 later reduced to 396 of shares controlled by khodorkovskiy and other menatep members the government seemed to be moving more broadly against yukos in november with the opening of more investigations and the reported flight of several company officials to israel stressing that he hoped to protect the future of yukos khodorkovskiy resigned as chief executive on november 3 the next day the yukos board appointed simon kukes us citizen and chief of major russian oil firm to replace khodorkovskiy fallout of the arrest the fears of the oligarchs and others that privatization might be at least partially reversed has led putin in recent weeks to declare that renationalization is not on his agenda however perceptions that private enterprise was being threatened appeared httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21678 reinforced on october 29 when putins minister of natural resources stated that oilfield exploration licenses granted to yukos would probably be cancelled such perceptions may have been reflected in the plummeting share price of yukos stock and in central bank officials statement on november 10 that muchhailed net capital inflows during early 2003 had reverted to net outflows however russian officials have allowed yukos and the sibneft oil firm to proceed with their merger which reportedly creates the worlds largest private oil firm in terms of reserves and the fourthlargest in terms of production many analysts speculate that the arrest was orchestrated by group of putins appointees linked to his career in the security service and in st petersburg including presidential staffers viktor ivanov and igor sechin this group termed by some the siloviki strong ones came to oppose alexander voloshin head of the presidential administration who was appointed by former president boris yeltsin and had purported ties to many of the oligarchs facing his loss of influence within the administration and denouncing khodorkovskiys arrest voloshin resigned on october 30 sechin and ivanov may not have gained more influence however since putin quickly appointed voloshins assistant the reportedly moderate dmitriy medvedev to replace him medvedev on november 2 appeared critical of the broadening investigation of yukos urging prosecutors to think through all the economic consequences of their decisions novosti nov 3 prime minister mikhail kasyanov on november 11 likewise called on the government to ensure unshakable private property rights anatoliy chubais chief of the united energy systems electric utility ues 51 of shares are stateowned and leader of the union of right forces party supported by khodorkovskiy has been the most prominent company head to criticize khodorkovskiys arrest some observers have warned that chubais who during the 1990s led privatization efforts and is hence widely unpopular may soon become target of investigation it appears that after some temporizing putin moved during november to stanch the intense domestic and international criticism of the moves against yukos and to prevent the case from seriously damaging russias energy sector and economic growth on november 4 he argued that the yukos case was similar to the us enron scandal and was simple law enforcement matter and the next day publicly rebuked his natural crs3 resources minister for suggesting that licenses might be revoked stating that the state should not strive to destroy yukos he also discussed the arrest on november 13 with the visiting head of the international monetary fund horst koehler who later stated that he was convinced that putin remained dedicated to free markets putin the next day met with large group of russian businessmen and pledged to protect private property rights but also pointedly warned them not to lobby legislators and bureaucrats for favors implications for russia some observers in russia have explained moves by the putin administration against the oligarchs in terms of marker laid down by putin in mid2000 in closed meeting with the oligarchs putin allegedly pledged not to revisit the privatization deals if they did not become involved in opposition political activities these observers suggest that the putin administrations prosecution of khodorkovskiy as well as earlier moves against prominent oligarchs may be explained in part by the administrations displeasure over their political activities fbis sept 16 doc cep89 oct 29 doc cep309 oct 30 doc cep316 in 2003 khodorkovskiy had become active in funding liberal causes and opposition parties and hinted that he might eventually run for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21678 president his arrest and putins november 14 speech to businessmen served to drive home this message to stay out of politics in this view while many russian businessmen have argued that they have the rights of any citizen to lobby the government for preferred policies and to otherwise participate in politics putin has strongly asserted that their political influence should be limited to these businessmen and other observers the governments moves against yukos have indicated that neither the rule of law nor public opinion appear to offer much support for their rights economist intelligence unit nov 7 the moves against khodorkovskiy and yukos were politically orchestrated and belied the independence of the judicial system according to this view and confirmed that neither democracy nor capitalism has taken hold in russia washington post nov 12 poll taken by the respected romir public opinion firm at the end of october indicated scant popular support for khodorkovskiy with over half of those who knew about his arrest about onefourth did not endorsing it and believing that his company had broken the law reuters nov 5 sea change of policy some observers have warned that the moves against yukos mark the launch of fundamental changes in politics and economics us analyst stephen f cohen has argued that the struggle over the oligarchical system and thus once again the future of postsoviet russia is under way and that the result may be far reaching economic changes including the removal of the oligarchs the nation nov 24 international financier george soros has warned that putin is creating state capitalism where the private sector is controlled by the state while others have suggested that putin aims to create chinesestyle capitalism where russian businessmen are not permitted to interfere in politics and foreign investment is controlled other implications may include greater efforts by russia to use its energy firms as instruments of foreign policy as advocated by defense minister sergey ivanov siloviki on november 17 other analysts view the governments moves against khodorkovskiy as designed mainly to wipe out his growing influence over russias energy sector and increase the influence of the government over this sector these analysts suggest that putin has had an interest since he became prime minister in 1999 in limiting the influence of the crs4 oligarchs over oil and gas resources they assert that the state dumas inability to enact bills backed by the government to broaden state controls over natural resource development legislation that khodorkovskiy lobbied against calls by yukos for an end to the russian governments total ownership of pipelines challenges to tax rates by yukos and rumors that major us and foreign oil firms might become major shareholders in russias largest oil firm contributed to governments retaliation against khodorkovskiy us analyst anders aslund however has discounted the governments interest in the oil sector suggesting on november 4 that the moves against khodorovskiy had primarily political motives of eliminating rival for power voice of america nov 5 suggestive of this motive russias deputy prosecutor has stated that khodorkovskiy might be detained for up to two years or longer well beyond the 2004 presidential race having blocked khodorkovskiys political ambitions the russian government will not further jeopardize economic growth in this view the privatizations of the 1990s as well as the domination of the economy by monopolies and the states partial or controlling interests in many major firms will remain in place moscow times nov 13 the rise of the siloviki the yukos case appeared to highlight increasing contention within the putin administration over economic policy with one group httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21678 advocating some degree of free enterprise the prooligarch yeltsinites who are holdovers from the previous administration and another group calling for more state control over the economy the siloviki the siloviki also tend to be more distrustful of ties with the west than the yeltsinites putin has appeared to support the yukos probe launched by the siloviki although opinions differ among many observers on the degree of his support and control over them to remedy the apparent rift within the putin administration between the rising siloviki and the weakening yeltsinites medvedev may be seeking to forge compromise between them although weakened by voloshins resignation the yeltsinites appear to retain some influence through prime minister mikhail kasyanov the strengthening of the siloviki faction appears to include growing support for it even among some administration moderates such as finance minister alexey kudrin who on november 3 welcomed the moves against yukos as heralding more honest marketplace some observers suggest that there are recent signs that the siloviki might be exceeding putins wishes alternatively they may be carrying them out including reports that the natural resources ministry and regional authorities are stepping up their threats to revoke yukos licenses the government also reportedly has eliminated some tax exemptions affecting yukos and orchestrated the quick duma repeal on november 18 of khodorkovskiyinfluenced law that had limited export taxes on oil investment outcomes the affair has appeared to delay some foreign investment although some caution may have more to do with the uncertainties of the russian election cycle than with the yukos case according to some analysts however the yukos probe may have boosted investor concerns about the economic and political policies that might be pursued by putin in his second term andrius vilkancas reuters november 9 although foreign investment is significant for major projects and sectors it currently plays small role in the russian economy compared to domestic investment by russian firms if there are further government moves against private property russian entrepreneurs might react by eschewing investments in plant and equipment and sending their capital abroad financial times nov 11 the international energy agency of the organization for economic cooperation and development warned on november 13 that russian government moves against yukos and possible delays in foreign investment could contribute to faltering production that may harm russias economic growth more crs5 optimistically the credit rating firm moodys stated on november 12 that it would stand by its designation that russian government bonds were investmentgrade reflecting its assessment that the russian economy would retain strong growth several international energy and other firms have stated that they are not changing their investment plans campaign effects although much of the russian public appeared to be unaware of or indifferent to the governments moves against yukos they have been prominently discussed by duma candidates during campaigning ahead of the december 7 election putins favored united russia party bloc has appeared to gain support by attacking the oligarchs effectively coopting an issue that was staple of the communist party the communists also appeared compromised by accepting some support from some oligarchs and even listing them as candidates two parties that had received major support from khodorkovskiy yabloko and the union of right forces warned of an assault on the market economy and the imposition of authoritarian rule their efforts to attract voters appeared severely set back both by the cutoff of khodorkovskiys funding and the perception of many voters that they represent the superrich yablokos popularity also may have suffered when its offices were raided in october ostensibly as part of the yukos case few observers have asserted that the yukos investigation aims to discredit both httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21678 the communist party and yabloko in order to so reduce their appeal that they fail to meet threshold for any party list seats in the duma moscow tribune nov 21 implications for us interests opinions varied somewhat among us policymakers and analysts about the significance of russian government moves against yukos and khodorkovskiy to us interests among those more critical of the russian government us defense advisor richard perle on october 29 condemned khodorkovskiys arrest and called for russias exclusion from the group of eight g8 industrial nations wall street journal oct 30 others were more supportive of the russian government with one former us official hailing putin for revitalizing russian democracy and comparing him to the trustbusting us president theodore roosevelt washington times nov 11 these differences of viewpoint were apparent in assessments of the bush administrations response to the arrest some viewed the response as muted and mainly restricted to background and offtherecord criticisms while others viewed it as relatively forceful among official statements the state department on october 27 raised concerns about the selective nature of the arrest and the russian governments confrontational moves against yukos and on october 31 stated that the impoundment of yukos stock posed serious questions about the rule of law in russia and sparked concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights russian foreign minister igor ivanov two days later denounced these statements as interference in russias domestic affairs perhaps indicating more muted response secretary of state colin powell stated on november 4 that the case is playing out and i think its best for us just to see how the russians handle it seeming more forceful white house spokesman scott mcclellan on november 6 stated that the manner in which the case is being addressed has raised some serious concerns about the state of rule of law and the business and investment climate its important for russian authorities to dispel any concerns that this case is politically motivated crs6 energy and other usrussia ties some observers have raised concerns that the yukos case could jeopardize the us national interest in diversifying energy supplies including growing oil imports from russia currently over 500000 barrels per day as well as development proposals such as russian murmansk pipeline and port to supply oil for us markets dallas morning news nov 10 p 1d they also caution the united states to closely monitor the status of the siloviki and the upcoming russian elections which could contribute to changes in russian national security policy inimical to us interests khodorkovskiy and yukos have played prominent role in meetings of the us russia commercial energy dialogue that were launched by presidents bush and putin at their may 2002 summit khodorkovskiy highlighted plans for the murmansk pipeline at the september 2003 commercial energy summit oil daily sept 23 afp nov 15 in addition khodorkovskiys open russia foundation charity has been hailed by us officials as bolstering democratization in russia amb vershbow may 17 2002 some analysts argue that the administration should not overreact to the moves against yukos but should reaffirm core us national interests by continuing to engage with russia to include cooperation on counterterrorism nato afghanistan and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to iran and north korea as well as cooperation on energy development reuters nov 4 for details on usrussia ties httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21678 and russian foreign policy see crs issue brief ib92089 russia many us oil companies have indicated that despite the yukos case russias oil exports and reserves make it world player that is hard to ignore perhaps reflecting prevailing attitude the chairman of the energy services firm halliburton on november 5 stated that he hoped his firm would in the future play big role in russia but that he had some concerns that rule of law problems make the market iffy in terms of profitability reuters nov 5 kukes appointment as chief of yukos where he joins two other executives who are us citizens brings to the fore someone who previously worked for us oil firms perhaps boding well for future cooperation between yukos or its successor and the us energy sector congressional concerns several members of congress have been at the forefront in raising us concerns about the khodorkovskiy arrest and moves against yukos meeting with members of congress on november 4 to formalize cooperative ties the chairman of russias upper legislative chamber sergey mironov endeavored to reassure them that there are political economic or election goals in the yukos probe and that usrussia ties therefore should not be negatively affected itartass nov 4 despite these assurances that same day senate foreign relations committee chairman richard lugar introduced sres 258 which calls for khodorkovskiys human rights to be respected and for russia to dispel concerns that cases against business leaders are politically motivated and that the legal system is being misused also among the concerns are the russian governments seeming preoccupation with prosecuting jewish oligarchs senate commerce committee chairman john mccain also strongly warned that creeping coup against the forces of democracy and market capitalism in russia is threatening the foundation of the usrussia relationship and called on the us government to cease all guarantees of investment in russia due to the unacceptable risk of state interference and expropriation the russian foreign ministry responded by criticizing mccain for lapsing into cold war stereotypes and outrageously trying to harm the usrussian strategic partnership cr nov 4 pp s138667 ap nov 4
