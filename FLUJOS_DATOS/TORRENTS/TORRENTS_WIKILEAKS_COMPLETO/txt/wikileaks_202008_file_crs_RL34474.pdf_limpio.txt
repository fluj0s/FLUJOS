science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34474high agricultural commodity prices what are the issues summary prices for nearly all major us agricultural program crops corn barley sorghum oats wheat rice and soybeans have exhibited extreme price volatility since mid2007 while rising to record or nearrecord levels in early 2008 several international organizations have announced that the shar ply rising commodity prices are likely to have dire consequences for the worlds vulnerable populations particularly in importdepe ndent less developed nations in the united states high commodity prices have pushed farm inco to successive nnual records and have sharply lowered government farm program costs but they have also stoked the flames of food price inflation and have ra ised costs for livestock producers and food processors in addition high unexpectedly vola tile prices have increased the risk and costs associated with grain merchandising in particular th ey have dramatically increased the cost of routine hedging activities ie pricing commodities for purchase delivery or use at some future date at commodity futures exchanges and as result have diminished forward c ontracting opportunities for grain and oilseed producers who are eager to take advant age of record high market prices for some crops particularly for wheat and rice the price increases are likely to be relatively shortterm in nature and are due to w eatherrelated crop shortfalls in major producer and consumer countries w eak us dollar that has helped spark large increases in us exports bidding war among major us crops for land in the months leading up to spring planting in 2008 and the often perverse price effects resulting from internationa l policy responses by veral major exporting and importing nations to protect their domestic markets assuming return to normal weather these factors will likely selfcorrect within two growing seasons as global supplies are replenished and prices modera for coarse grains corn sorghum barley oats and rye oilseeds and oils eed products eg vegetable oil and meal the price increases have also been due to strong sustained demand deriving from two sources robust income growth in developing countries eg china and india which has contributed to increased demand for meat products and the feed grains needed to produce that meat and growing agricultu ral feedstock demand to meet large increases in government biofuelusage ma ndates or goals in the united states the european union and other countries market analysts including the ited nations food and agricultural organization fao are predicting record global grain and oilseed production in 2008 in response to the high market prices however given the overall strength in demand growth most market analysts predict that when commodity supplies eventually recover and prices moderate from current high levels the new equilibrium prices will be significantly higher than has

since the mid1990s figures 1 and 2 while agricultural commodity prices rose sharply during 2007 they jumped precipitous ly in early 2008 for example export prices for the worlds two major food crops wheat and rice rose by 81 and 21 respectively during 2007 but have surged even higher in early 2008 wheat prices hrw 2 fob us gulf ports rose 44 between november 2007 and march 2008 rising from 3346

crisis is depicted as silent tsunami by kevin sullivan washington post april 23 2008global food crises declared by united nations while the high market prices have been boon for producers and owners of agricultural commodities they represen t drastically worsening food security outlook for lowincome households partic ularly those in poor importdependent countries3 global crisis was signaled when on march 20 2008 josette sheeran the executive director of the united nati ons world food program wfp issued an appeal for 500 million from donor countries to close an immediate gap in the wfps normal food distribution commitme nts resulting from rising commodity prices4 this was followed on april 14 2008 by warning from secretary general ban kimoon that rapidly calating global food crisis had reached emergency proportions and threatened to wipe out seven years of progress in the fight against poverty5 world bank president robert b zoellick announced that the surge in food prices could push 100 million peopl living in lowincome countries into deeper poverty6 that same month the uns food and agricultural organization fao identified 37 c ountries in food crisis requiring external assistance 21 of them in africa7 then on april 22 2008 barely month after her first announcement executive director sheeran announced that the wfps operation funding gap had now risen to 755 milli on up from the earlier estimate of 500 million due to continuing increases in commodity prices since midmarch8 in addition to global food security c oncerns higher commodity prices have stoked the flames of food price inflation and its potentially deleterious effect on lowerincome households while raising costs for livestock feeders and food processors because the rising prices have been associated with unexpectedly large price volatility they also have increased the risk and costs of grain merchandising all along the marketing chain finally the high volatile commodity prices have dramatically increased the cost of routine hedging activities ie pricing commodities for purchase delivery or use at some future date at commodity futures exchanges and thereby diminished forward contracting opportunities for grain and oilseed producers who are eager to take dvantage of record hi gh market priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34474crs4 9 for brief description of these earlier peri ods see global grain markets in 1996 shades of 197274 by pete riley agricultural outlook september 1996 pp 26not all commodities are equal the specific circumstances leading to high market prices eg weather related supply shortfalls unexpected surges in demand marketdistorting government policies vary in important ways for each of the major us program crops for wheat combination of inte rnational weatherrela ted crop failures over the past two years that has resulted in hi storically low us and global stock levels is the primary impetus behind high prices government policies by several key foreign producers to limit exports in favor of domestic markets also have contributed to higher prices for coarse grains nd oilseeds combination of growing demand bolstered by rapid income growth in veloping markets and government biofuels policies are the key drivers for rice government policies by several major rice exporting countries since late 2007 to limit exports followed by panic buying on the part of several importdepe ndent rice buyers most notably the philippines are the primary catalysts for cotton where globa l supplies remain re latively abundant the general bull market mentality that currently dominates global markets for nearly all commodities has likely been major c ontributor to what are otherwise unusually high prices given cottons cu rrent supply and demand balance of course single event or circumstance fully explains high prices for any single commodity global economic growt h in general reinforces demand for all agricultural commodities lack of sustained investment in the agricultural sector diminishes longterm productivity potentia l dampens producer incentives and contributes to the slow erosion of food s upply availability high prices for one crop spill over into markets for other crops that compete for the same agricultural land ban on rice or wheat exports by one count ry ripples through all commodity markets that compete for the consumers food budget and as backdrop record oil prices have raised costs all along the various commodity marketing chains from field to kitchen table high prices case of deja vu the last period of similarly high co mmodity prices occurred in the 19951996 period when several years of government stock reductions were followed by an unusual combination of global supply reducing weather events and strong international demand9 however current commodity market conditions for major us farm program crops which have ccurred simultaneously with dramatic price rises in coffee cocoa and tea markets as well as in nonagricultural markets eg petroleum gold silver platinum copper aluminum iron ore and coal appear more reminiscent of the 19721974 period when increasing inflation gasoline shortages and fears of widespread resour ce depletion appeared to place constraints on economic growth and food production httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34474crs5 10 for more information see crs report rs21970 the us farm economy in the current farm commodity bull market global stocksrelativetouse ratios for vegetable oils and several grain crops are projected to reach historic lows by mid 2008 table 1 as result commodity prices in both cash and futures markets have approached or surpassed historic highs tables 2 and 3 while exhibiting heightened sensitivity to crop prospects across the globe this year this sensitivity has translated into record price volatility in agricultural markets the full consequences of historically high but unpred ictably volatile commodity pr ices are only beginning to emerge but clearly they have raised the cost of doing business and such costs have not been spread evenly among market participants on the positive side high commodity prices have contributed to record us farm income in 2007 and the outlook for even higher returns in 2008 while dramatically reducing government ou tlays for pricecontingent commodity programs10 on the other hand the outlook for stained high commodity prices has contributed to the concerns of the us liv estock sector and food processors about the continued timely availa bility of grain and oilseed supplies and the impact such high input prices have had on thei r profitability historic hi gh price levels and volatility have sharply increased the costs of routine hedging activities of commercial elevators grain merchandisers and food processors in addition as commodity prices have risen in tandem with food prices consumers from lowincome households and importde pendent nations have expresse d concerns often in the form of riots about food price inflation dom estic and internati onal food aid and the ability of agricultural producers to meet projections for tinued strong demand growth us and global stocks near historic lows for several crops us and global stocks for several major us program commodities are expected to be at or near historically low levels particularly when measured as share of total usage prior to the next harvest this coming summer and fall of 2008 table 1 and figures 38 for example global endofyear stocks for coarse grains and wheat are projected to drop by mid 2008 to the lowest levels since 1977 while ending stocks of total grains ie rice wh eat and coarse grains combined fall to the lowest level since 1981 more importantly their respectiv stockstouse ratios are all projected to reach record lows simila rly the stockstouse ratios for global corn and vegetable oils are projected to be th tightest since the early 1970s global rice stocks as well as the stockstouse ratio are projected up slightly from the previous year at 772 million tons and 182 in 2007 2008 however the previous years stockstouse ratio of 181 was the lowe st since 1976 current rice stock levels represent halving

commodity markets primer by randy schnepfa certain amount of stocks at the end of the marketing year are necessary to provide continuous flow of grain to pro cessors and exporters before the new crop is harvested such stocks are referred to as pipeline supplies although there is hard and fast rule on what volume of stocks represents desirable pipeline levels for the major grain and oilseed crops whenever stocks approach hist orically low levels market analysts speculate about what pipe linestock levels might be for wheat us pipeline stocks are estimated to be in range of 95 to 11 million tons 350 to 400 million bushels for corn 10 to 12 million tons 400 to 500 million bushels and for soybeans about 4 to 55 million t ons 150 to 200 m illion bushels11 whenever usda ending stock projections approach th levels market prices become very sensitive to unexpected market news and prices tend to be more volatile than during periods of abundant stocks us wheat ending stocks for 20072008 are pr ojected to fall to their lowest level 239 million bushels or 65 million tons si nce 1947 well below their pipeline range us soybean stocks of 44 million tons are projected at the lower end of their pipeline range us corn ending stocks although projected at what would appear to be an ample level are low in historical global supplytouse terms furthermore the multiyear outlook for corn supplies is strongly impacted by the biofuels usage mandate in the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 which suggests that corn supplies will continue to tighten through 2015 among the major program crops cotton is the principal excep tion with global and us ending stocks projected at relatively abundant leve ls in 20082009 usda projects that global coarse grain stocks will continue to tighten while wheat and rice stocks rebuild slightly on the outlook for record harvests ending stocks are calculated as the di fference between total supplies beginning stocks plus production plus imports and total disappearance all domestic uses plus exports as such seasonending st ocks of an annually produced commodity summarize the effects of both supply and demand factors during the marketing year expected ending stocks expressed as ratio over expected total use are frequently used as an indicator of co mmoditys expected price outcome by usda and other market observers12 for most seasonal commod ities annual prices tend to have strong negative correlation with their ending stockstouse ratio figures 38 as result expectations for high stocks relative to use typically result in lower prices while expectations for low stocks relative to use tend to raise prices httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34474crs8 1970 1980 1990 2000 201012345678 020406080100 source 19702006usda ers wheat

established in 2008 the tight supply situation for many ag ricultural commodities has sparked higher commodity prices throughout the global marketing chain farm gate futures markets major international ports of call wholesale distributi on points and finally to retail prices however not all prices respond with the same speed and volatility prices for electronicallytra ded agricultural futures mark et contracts respond almost instantaneously to new market information in contrast farm prices are weighted by markets large share of which occur immediately after harvest when prices are generally at their lowest point of the s eason and often respond more to local rather than international market conditions wholesale and export market prices fall somewhere between farm and futures market prices in terms of their responsiveness to changing conditions several futures prices set alltime highs unlike cash markets which deal with the immediate transfer of goods futures exchange provides the facilities for buyers and sellers to trade commodity futures contracts that is contracts to buy or sell specified volume of commodity subject to detailed quality conditions at fixed price for potential physical delivery or acquisition at some future date commodity futures exchanges are important barometers of commodity pr ice movements both the general level as well as the volatility because they function as central exchange for domestic and international market informa tion market participants are able to respond with buy or sell orders w ithin sec onds upon r eceiving new information as result futures contract prices react almost instantaneously to new information regarding commodity supply and demand expectations this futu res market activity eg price volume open interest is then reported electronically by the major exchanges through their own news media as well as through national and interna tional news media13 as result of this transparency futures exchanges have served two critical roles price discovery and risk management in facilitating the marketing of agricultural commodities the market circumstances of the first few months in 2008 have clearly manifested themselves in the commodity futures exchanges where prices for many commodities have hit historic alltime highs table 2 for example at the chicago board of trade cbot prices for

in developing countries such as china and india has contributed to permanent increase in global demand for more and different kinds of food21 as households improve their incomes and f ood purchasing

table 4 substantial portion of corn price effects are likely transmitted to the soybean market via competition fo r land primarily in the corn belt where soybeans and corn are both widely grown the biofuels price effects would also transmit to regions outside of the corn belt where wheat cotton and other major grain and oilseeds are produced as farmers reconfigure their planting decisions and opt for greater soybean and corn production to maximize returns similar study by the center for agricultural research and development card found that jointly the rfs and tc supported the price of corn

biofuels polic will not necessarily result in reversal of the ethanol sect ors impact on corn prices and commodity markets in the long run babcock says that the impacts of fe deral biofuels policy depend crucially on the price of crude oil and the number of ethanol plants that get constructed under current incentives this is because agricultural commodity prices and gasoline prices are now inextricably linked through existing ethanol plants and the knowledge of how to efficiently c onvert corn to transportation fuel foreign government policies to limit exports foreign government policy

rising internal inflation have instituted policies signed to limit exports of domestic supplies these policies albeit implemented to dampen internal prices for domestic consumers have had exactly the opposite effect on international market prices pushing them higher than supply and demand conditions would otherwise dictate by limiting access to available supplies by intern ational buyers on apr il 24 2008 the wfp claimed that more than 40 foodexporting countries had pl aced some kind of restriction or outright ban on many crop exports in an attempt to stabilize prices within their borders33 export bans have had particularly acute effect in the thinly traded international rice market traditionally less than 7 of annual global rice production enters world markets as result removal of even modest volumes of exportable supplies can have profound effects ce late 2007 four traditional ex porters including vietnam india china and egypt the worlds sec ond fourth sixth and eighthleading rice exporters last year along with minor exporter cambodia ve all set in place policies to limit exports the combined effect of these bans is to remove over third of available export supplies from world markets and to drive international rice prices sharply higher the removal of these s upplies was followed by panic buying by the philippines as it aggressively sought to acquire share of remaining exportable supplies34 similar action in the international wheat market includes both ukraine and argentina which in the spring of 2007 initia ted wheat export restrictions in efforts to control food price inflation pakistan placed taxes on wheat exports by late february 2008 kazakhstan officials set in place policies to slow their countrys wheat export pace via higher custom duties also due to

addition many countries froze internal commodity prices at below market levels and issued temporary income subsidies to help consumers meet their f ood needs while these consumeroriented actions may

petroleum prices and strong demand for ocean shipping drove ocean rates for shipping bulk commodities to record levels in 2007 nearly doubling the previous record set in 2004 and adding to the

commodity exports and higher oil prices since oil is priced in us dollars in international markets weakening dollar is generally perceived as contributing to hi gher oil prices via two mechanisms first oil exporters must raise the dollar price per barrel to retain the same level of purchase power against appreciating nonus curre ncies second oil importers whose currencies have generally st

billion comprise the majority of government subsidy expenditures crop insurance premiums costs surge in 2008 commodity prices are key ingredient in the formula for calculating crop insurance premiums49 higher more volatile prices lead to higher insurance premiums but they also provide the oppor tunity for producers to lock in unusually high peracre returns both volatility and absolute prices levels are substantially higher in 2008 than in 2007 for all major program crops for example the base price for co rn was 406 per bushel in 2007 compared with 525 in 2008 an increase of 119 or 2950 the higher price level plus this years higher volatility figure 12 translate into higher crop insurance premiums premiums vary by crop and location as well as the farms production history however higher base price also means that the per acre returns being insured are substantially higher in 2008 especially si nce most crop insurance policies sold are revenue products that allow farm ers to insure target level of revenue rather than just yields51 many farmers on traditionally highyielding farms in the corn belt will be able to guarantee corn revenues in the 500 per acre range for 75 coverage level guarantees over 600 are possible with hi gher coverage vels similar high insurance premiums and revenue guarantees will be available for most major program crops in most major producing areas unlike government commodity program outlays which decline when prices rise government support for fe deral crop insurance rises with higher prices this is because the federal government subsidizes the premiums by an average of 50 to 60 of the total premium depending on the coverage level in addition the government reimburses the insurance companies for share of their administrative and operating expenses incurred in delivering the crop insurance policies the reimbursement share of administrative and operating expenses is based on percentage of total premiums thus it also rises

producers are equally concerned because as grain and oilseed buyers refrain from offering forward contracts producers are increasingly unable to take advantage of the current high prices forward contractin g has traditionally been one of the primary risk management strategies em ployed by us producers57 it is not clear to what extent if any high commodity prices have had on the perceived lack of convergence the commodity futures trading commission cftc the government agency responsible for oversight and regulation of us futures exchanges has said that an examination of futures trading data has yet to show any visible evidence that hedging operations are declining as result of the rising financial obligations associated with hedging58 in addition economists have studied the emerging lack of convergence between cash and futures prices and have yet to identify any significant causal factor59 despite any current lack of evidence some agricultural interests affected by these issues have accused the growing pool of speculative money that has been invested in agricultural futures markets in recent years of artificially increasing prices and their volatility and sharply raising the costs of standard hedging operations as result these parties have called for great er federal regulation and monitoring over speculative participation in futures markets as well as for more stringent trading limits on speculative funds as general rule this type of speculative investment in futures markets is considered to add necessary liquidity to commodity markets several other issues related to the efficient functioning of futures markets that have emerged in recent years for example electronic trading and the standard practice of raising limits on the daily movement of contract prices when

emerging issues expanded more intensive agricultural production since most of the increase in demand is considered permanent commodity prices will likely return to lower levels only through an expansion in aggregate supply from either domestic or foreign sour ces that outpaces demand growth this in turn may be accomplished by increases in either yields or cu ltivated area the strong market price signals received by the worlds farmers during the past six months are expected to gender response in both planted area and yield per unit of planted area in 2008 agricultural productivity yield increases generally accumulate slowly over time via more intensive use of fertilizers pesticides improved seeds and adoption of better farming practices which th emselves are generally the product of investments in research exte nsion and infrastructure the availability and cost of fertilizers and chemicals can be limiting factor on shortterm yield gains furthermore adoption of more intensive cultivation practices may contribute to potentially harmful environmental consequences such as possible water quality degradation from fertilizer and chemical runoff and increased soil erosion expanded cropped area area increases for given crop can occur more quickly than yield increases by shifting land use among different crops by altering rotational tillagefallo w cultivation practices or by bringing marginal less productive soils into cultivation landuse shifts imply winners and losers among crops while altering rotational patterns and farming marginal lands all imply potentially harmful environmen tal consequences such as reduced wildlife habitat lower soil fertility increased erosion possible water quality degradation from nutrient and sediment loads in rural wate rways and

commodity prices in 2007 most economists agree that energy costs particularly fuel prices have played larger role in food price inflation than have commodity prices74 in general retail f ood prices are much less volatile than farmlevel prices and tend to rise by fraction of the change in farm prices this is because the actual farm product represents only small share of the eventual retail price 20 on average whereas transportation processing packaging advertising handling and ot her costs all vulnerable to higher fuel prices comprise the majority of the final sales price75 because food expenditures represent relatively small share of consumer spending for most us households food price increases are absorbed relatively easily in the short run on average in 2006 us households spend about 6 of their total disposable personal in come on food consumed at home and another 4 on food consumed away from home for total food outlay of about 105 76 however even in wealthy nation such as the united st ates household income variations suggest that the impact of food price inflation can vary widely and can result in painful spending choices at the household level in 2006 us families

food needs78 the two largest programs food stamps and child nutriti on programs operate as titlement programs that make specified payments to all qualifying beneficiaries however in the case of food stamps the burden is upon the eligible i ndividuals to seek out the benefits in general rising food prices result in high er federal spending on food stamps and child nutrition programs because participation expands and because the benefits under most federal food assistance programs are indexed to some type of consumer food basket that would also rise with high er prices in 2007 332 billion
