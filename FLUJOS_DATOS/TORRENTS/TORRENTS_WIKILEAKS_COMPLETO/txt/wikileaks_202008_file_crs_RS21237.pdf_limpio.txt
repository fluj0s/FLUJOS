summary until 2005 india and pakistan were the only states outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to declare openly their nuclear weapons capability in 1998 they tested nuclear weapons and since th deployed ballistic missiles enunciated nuclear doctrine and made or ganizational changes to their nuclear establishments in 2002 they teetered on the brink of war in ka shmir this paper summarizes indian and pakistani nuclear weapon capabi lities and thinking and discusses some confidence building measures in place intended to help avert nuclear war it will be updated as events warrant background almost 50 years of nuclear ambiguity were swept away by the may 1998 nuclear tests of india and pakistan optimists hoped that overt nuc lear weapons capabilities could help provide more conventi onal stability and that limited nuc lear arsenals might dampen competition in missile development1 the 1999 conflict in kargil and 2002 crisis in kashmir challenged this viewpoint2 south asia remains nuclear flashpoint and potentially source for terrorists of access to weapons of mass destruction indian nuclear weapon capa bilities and thinking india began its nuclear program shortly after independence in 1947 after humiliating defeat in border war with chin in 1962 followed by chinas first nuclear test in 1964 the drive for nuclear weapons intensified the 1974 test of peaceful nuclear device was an importa nt milestone but it took severa l more years to develop nuclear weapons capability simultaneously i ndia developed nuclear infrastructure that supported both civilian and military purposes for example indias development ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21237crs2 3 the stockholm peace research institute estimated 60120 warheads in 1995 but 2540 warheads in 2000 the bulletin of atomic scientists estimated 50 in 1998 but 3035 in 2002 estimates often calculate how much material theo retically is available but few estimates are based on information about actual weapons another variable is how much material is needed per weapon traditionally it is thought to be 25kg of highlyenriched uranium or 8kgs of plutonium but estimates often use smaller figures one i ndian

nuclear power plan ts and its plutoniumbased weapons the size of indias nuclear stockpile has b een topic of considerable debate within scientific and defense communities3 estimates vary from few to 100 but several converge on around 3035 weapons probably st ored in component form the us department of defense believes that india is capable of manufacturing complete sets of components for plutoniumbased weapons and has small st ockpile of such components india probably can deploy few nuclear w eapons within few days to weekand can deliver these weapons with fighter aircraft4 most agree that india is expanding its stockpile and that if india uses unsafeguarded reactorgrade plutonium the potential to expand its stockpile is very significant indias delivery capability has long reflected two very different contingencies china and pakistan because of the distances involved and indias lack of longrange bombers capability against china inevitably required ballistic missiles against pakistan however indian officials recognized early on that aircraft would be more valuable particularly in retaliatory st rike the indian air force is significantly more sophisticated and capable than pakistans5 india has some 35 mirage 2000 fighters that are nuclear capable although other aircra ft could also be used ballistic missiles add consider able instability into the security equation because they are high priority targets the pressure to us them quickly and for the other side to strike them preemptively is great indian officials have said shortrange prithvi ballistic missiles 150km and 250km ranges are conve ntionally armed wh ile nuclearcapable and able to reach almost all of pakistan the use of nucleararmed prithvi s could pose major risks of fallout to india6 india has deployed agniii missiles with 1500 km range and tested an 800 km range version of the agni earlier this year these solidfueled missiles which reportedly can be launched within minutes c

trine reiterated some of the points in the 1999 draft document on nuclear doctrine produced by the national security advisory board and refined others in summary the document committed india to credible minimum deterrent defined as 1 posture of first use and use against non nuclear weapon states with the exception of the right to retaliate with nuclear

political council chaired by th prime minister and authorize the use of nuclear weapons and an executive council chaired by the national security advisor pakistani nuclear weapon capabilities and thinking pakistans nuclear program dates back to the 1950s but it was the humiliating loss of east pakistan now bangladesh that reportedly triggered political decision in january 1972 just one month later to begin crash nuclear weapons program unlike india pakistan focused on the uranium route to weapons pakistan sought technology from many sources including china and north korea8 this extensive assistance is reported to have included among other things ur anium enrichment technology from europe blueprints for small nuclear weapon from china and missile technology from china most observers estimate that pakistan s enough nuclear material highly enriched uranium and small amount of plut onium for 30 to 50 nuclear weapons9 like india pakistan is thought to have small stoc kpile of nuclear wea pons components and can probably assemble some weapons fairly quickly10 pakistan could deliver its nuclear weapons using f16s it purchased from the united states 28 f16 and 12 trainer aircraft 8

in the direction of lahore illuminating pakistans vulnerabilitypakistan has not yet enuncia ted nuclear doctrine but it is clear that pakistans nuclear arsenal is seen as the key to military parity with india because of its fears of being overrun by larger indian forces pakist an has rejected the doc trine of nofirstuse in may 2002 pakistans ambassador to the munir akram stated that we have not said we will use nuclear wea pons we have not said we will not use nuclear weapons we possess nuclear weapons so does india we will not neutralize the deterrence by any doctrine of first use12 on june 4 2002 president musharraf went further the possession of nuclear weapons by any stat obviously implies they will be used under some circumstances13 in recent years pakistan apparently s taken steps toward refining command and control of nuclear weapons in april 1999 general musharraf announced that the joint staff headquarters would have command and control arrangem ent and secretariat and strategic force command would be established14 the connection to civilian leadership was unclear given recent account of the 1999 kargil incursion which suggested that prime minister sharif was unaware that hi s own nuclear missile forces were being prepared for action15 pakistan established national command authority nca in february 2000 but little is public ly known about it pakistan i officials have repeatedly said that their nuclear capabilities are safe the new nca is believed to be responsible for nuclear doctrine as well as nuclear research and development wartime command and control and advice to president musharra f about the development and employment of nuclear weapons16 role of kashmir kashmir has been flashpoint since i ndian and pakistani independence in 1947 many analysts have feared that nuclear w eapons could be used if conventi onal hostilities over kashmir were to spiral out of control especially if as in 1965 indopakistan conflict india opened new front on the p unjab plains to break stalemate in pakistan or attempt to settle the issue decisively by confronting pa kistan with mortal threat to its territorial integrity17 under these circumstances some have suggested pakistan might be tempted to detonate small nuclear weapon on its own territory to halt forward indian movement other observers however believe such strategy would be akin to state

rraftranscriptindexhtmlsuicide bomber18 some media reports have suggested that paradoxically the fact that both countries have very small nuclear arsenals increases the pressure on both sides to use their weapons against highvalue targets19 regardless of whether nuclear weapons might be used to stop war or to gain military advantage many observers agree that uncertainty about intentions could worsen stability since 1998 both india and pakistan appear to be integrating nuclear weapons into security strategy and planning with the minous logic of nuclear deterrence each sides desire to make its nuclear forces more credible may make those nuclear forces more usable ballistic missiles offer both sides advantages over using aircraft as delivery vehicles but the short ranges create hairtrigger situa tion from launch to impact missile flight times may be as short as 5 minutes in the past both sides appeared to use the separation of warhead components as form of command and control in the sense of lowering the risk of unauthorized or accide ntal use some observers have noted that this approach becomes risky when the other side can launch shortrange ballistic missiles against which there is defense these observers have called for improving command and control of nuclear forces while noting ironically that reduced ambiguity could conversely increase the likelihood of war20 the defense intelligence agency reportedly has estimated that nuclear exchange could kill between 9 and 12 million persons on both sides with 2 to 6 million injured these estimates are likely predicated on nuclear exchanges aimed at cities eg indian defense secretary yogendra nara in suggested in 2002 that india would retaliate against pakistani aggression and that both sides s hould be prepared for mutual destruction president musharrafs interview in june 2002 with cnn offered respite from the nuclear rhetoric when he stated i don t think either side is that i rresponsible to go to that limit ie nuclear conflict one shouldnt even be discussing these things because any sane individual cannot even think of going in to this unconventional mode whatever the pressures21

been closely involved in efforts to prevent or slow the development of nucl ear arsenals by india and pakistan in the light of the global war on terrorism and limited pakistani cooperation in nonprolif eration congress might consid er the following questions what sources of leverage does the us now have toward india and pakistan are new sources of leverage visavi s indian and pakistani proliferation needed should new leverage be fo cused on averting nuclear use rather than on limiting nuclear proliferation should india and pakistan be prior ity recipients of cooperative threat reduction assistance what options exist in this regard that do not undermine us obligations as part to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty how effective are economic or othe r sanctions and which might work best
