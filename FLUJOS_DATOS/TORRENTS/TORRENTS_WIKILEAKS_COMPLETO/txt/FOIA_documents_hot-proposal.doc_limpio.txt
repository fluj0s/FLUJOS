article two hot sciencebased policy dialogue on fair and effective ways to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system and implications for postkyoto policies the aim of this project is to operationalise article 2 of the climate change convention which provides the longterm objective of the climate change regime this is seen as an important step towards ensuring that the consecutive shortterm steps adopted in the regime meet the longterm objective the ultimate objective of the climate convention raises the question of acceptable risk this is not an issue that can be addressed by scientists alone and calls for science based policy dialogue dialogue is time consuming process and to ensure that it is successful it is vital that the participants are committed to the process in terms of the issues involved the time they are willing to spend on the project and the need to engage seriously in dialogue as opposed to monologue or negotiation this calls for an intensive investment in the conditions that guarantee that such project will be successful hence the first phase of this project is essentially the preparatory phase which aims at putting in place the conditions that will ensure the international multicultural dialogue to be engaged in in phase 2 is effective the second phase is the actual dialogue process at regional and global levels aimed at producing document that articulates and elaborates on the different interpretations of article 2 and the reasoning that justifies these interpretation in the context of different perspectives helping operationalise article two hot sciencebased policy dialogue on fair and effective ways to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system and implications for postkyoto policies phase 1 1 introduction this proposal addresses phase 1 of twophase proposal entitled helping operationalise article two hot sciencebased policy dialogue on fair and effective ways to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system and implications for postkyoto policies this document provides brief problem description the objective of the project the research questions the methodology the project partners and research responsibilities of each partner the time line and deliverables budget references and the curriculum vitae of the key project personnel 2 the problem the climate change problem is being addressed through framework convention the united nations framework convention on climate change fccc and series of negotiated or anticipated protocols the convention provides longterm objective in article 2 the ultimate objective of this convention and any related legal instruments that the conference of the parties may adopt is to achieve in accordance with the relevant provisions of the convention the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system such level should be achieved within timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in sustainable manner with the adoption of the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 1997 global society has made first but small step towards the attainment of the ultimate goal of the climate convention in order to stabilise the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases ghgs emissions will have to be strongly reduced in the long term the level at which the concentrations of ghgs are eventually stabilised determines the overall level of global climate change at the same time the level of climate change and the severity of its impacts are highly uncertain particularly at the regional level given the large uncertainties about the impacts of different stabilisation levels it is necessary to address the question do we need to set longterm stabilisation targets in relation to greenhouse gas concentrations and are concentrations of ghgs in the atmosphere the most appropriate indicator for setting longterm targets climate change negotiations have so far focussed almost exclusively pm shortterm issues related to greenhouse gas mitifgation in the first commitment period 20082012 and the use of flexibility mechanisms ion the kyoto protocol however action outlined in the kyoto protocol represents the only first step towards achieving the overall objective of the fccc it is therefore necessary to look beyond shorterterm imperatives in order to address this objective and contribute towards sound and equitable long term solution to the challenge of climate change at the same time the debate on ratification and entry into force of the kyoto protocol has been marked by calls to broaden the ambit of the protocol by including developing country ghg mitigation commitments these demands have been countered by developing countries by references to their low cumulative and current per capita ghg emissions low per capital incomes low ghg intensity of gdp at purchasing power parity and high vulnerability and poor coping capacity to climate change impacts therefore there is strong need for dialogue amongst policymakers and stakeholders about acceptable and unacceptable climate change impacts about fair ways of dealing with the unequal distribution of impacts and about options for fair distribution of emission control and adaptation costs the level of climate change impacts is related to both the overall magnitude of the change the rate at which it occurs and the ability of the natural and human systems to tolerate or adapt to the change not all systems are equally vulnerable to climate change some systems are likely to adapt more easily than others human systems may adapt more easily than natural systems while developed countries generally have more adaptive capabilities than developing countries in assessing dangerous levels of climate change adaptation options and capabilities need to be taken into account this raises questions about how to evaluate different types of impacts and how to deal with regional and social differences in impacts this also raises questions about critical impacts impacts that should guide actions and intergenerational solidarity ie what time horizon should be taken when considering climate change impact risks the climate change problem basically constitutes risk problem where climate change impact risks need to be balanced against the risk of climate control policies acceptable levels of climate change will be defined in relation to the possible societal consequences of both impacts and mitigation efforts an assessment of nondangerous climate change thus also entails an assessment of the implications of climate change control policies climate change scientists are unable to define what would be an acceptable level and timeframe for global concentrations of greenhouse gases to be stabilised this is because the evaluation of climate change risks is essentially political issue moreover scientific uncertainties make it very difficult to assess the likelihood of possible climate change events and thus to quantify the risks of climate change in short the climate change issue is characterised as an unstructured problem where both the values at stake as well as the science is uncertain and subject of debate this type of postnormal science problem requires methodological framework within which scientists policy makers and other stakeholders can enter into dialogue to assess what level of danger in terms of possible impacts could be attached to different levels of climate change what could be the implications of false policy responses policies being either too loose or too stringent and hence what longterm concentration levels or alternative policy indicators may be considered acceptable and non acceptable and on what grounds criteriavalues the climate system will respond slowly to mitigation efforts impacts of climate change will continue to manifest themselves well beyond the moment global ghg emissions are being reduced and even after ghg concentrations have actually been stabilised this means that short term decisions about ghg emission control need to be evaluated from longterm perspective because they may foreclose longterm climate control options this raises the question of what longterm climate change targets would imply for global emission control policies in the short to medium term post 2012 policies in case longterm targets could be established it raises the question how we could hedge against the uncertainty about desired future levels of stabilisation of ghg concentrations also here dialogue between scientists policy makers and stakeholders will be essential for developing proper strategic responses 3 the objective of the project and of phase 1 the purpose of the hot project is to help better articulate and operationalise the ultimate objective as stated in article 2 of the climate change convention in specific terms on the basis of science based policy dialogue issues to be addressed include the impacts upon stakeholders of various levels of stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations costs and opportunities for mitigationadaptation in different regions given national circumstances the implications of climate change and mitigationadaptation for sustainable development and approaches to decision making for article 2 of the unfccc the project aims to link the debate on mediumterm post 2012 climate policy targets to long term perspectives on effective and fair climate change impact control and sustainable development facilitate scientifically wellinformed dialogue amongst climate change policy stakeholders about the options for defining what would constitute dangerous interference with the climate system as covered by article 2 of the fccc improve insights in differences of perspectives and common ground for building policy action and provide insights into options for fair and effective postkyoto global climate change regimes for mitigation impacts and adaptation the objectives of this phase 1 proposal are to identify the possible participants in such dialogue and to secure their commitment to the project to come to common problem definition dialogue agenda and methodology that will allow for effective and fair participation of all participants in the dialogue on article 2 to prepare detailed project proposal for the dialogue phase and to generate support amongst the policy and funding community for such dialogue at this point the question of why the project should have such an elaborate preparatory phase may arise the reasons for doing so are as follows dialogue process is an intensive timeconsuming process if the invitees and their offices are not convinced that the process serves any useful purpose or that they individually are likely to gain from the process they are unlikely to remain committed to the entire dialogue process for dialogue to be successful the same participants need to participate in the full process to communicate with and learn from each other and in the process to develop shared understanding of the values at stake policy options and their possible implications reasons and arguments behind different perceptions and interests and opportunities and conditions for coming to common positions it is very important therefore to invest time upfront in understanding the perspectives of the potential participants their conditions for participation and to design the process such that it benefits all who participate undertaking such preparatory phase will mean that diversity of views has been taken on board which will be further explored in the dialogue phase moreover given the constraints of time and resources the preparatory phase will also help ensure that we do not miss out on any significant issues in the dialogue phase 4 the research questions this project addresses the following research questions 1 how can article 2 of the fccc be elaborated into quantitative indicators for climate change control what operational criteria could be developed to indicate dangerous and nondangerous levels of anthropogenic interference with the climate system what danger threshold levels could be defined for each indicator what are the arguments supporting the alternative answers to the above questions which stakeholders are in favour of these arguments and why what are the common interests behind the different positions if any 2 what would be the implications for the longterm indicators andor values for global emission control on the short to medium term for the post kyoto period 3 how important is the operationalisation of the ultimate objective of the climate change convention to ensure that the short and medium term measures adopted under the regime are on target are there alternative approaches this project is framed within the context of article 2 within this context the articulation of the above questions may change during the initial preparatory phase of this project researching these questions also presupposes an effective and fair dialogue design and the proper utilisation of scientific knowledge thus the research questions for the first phase of this project are 1 how do the project partners and stakeholders redefine the above questions within the context of article 2 of the convention 2 how should the dialogue be designed to secure the fair and effective participation of various policy makers and stakeholders in the dialogue and effective utilisation of scientific knowledge the scope of this project is limited to articulating what is considered dangerous and non dangerous levels of anthropogenic interference with the climate system and its implications for global emission levels in specific timeframes it is not intended to focus on the issues of differentiation of emission control commitments unless the participants see this as an integral and unavoidable part of the discussion on article 2 however the attitudes of participants towards the issue of differentiated commitments is interesting in itself and also an important aspect of any global dialogue on climate change therefore the planned dialogue will engage with the question of differentiated commitments not as the central focus of discussion but as one of number of issues to be addressed and evaluated by participants 5 the methodology 1 introduction the hot project uses science based policy dialogue methodology which is appropriate within the context of postnormal scientific research see annex 1 for theoretical background the project will be based on an informal stakeholder policy makers dialogue with balanced representation of various regions views and affiliations but limited group size ca 30 for full interaction and personal involvement the focus of the dialogue will be more on the policy dimensions of issues than on the technical and scientific aspects the science is envisaged to perform supportive role to inform and clarify and to provide feedback on implications of options discussed it will pay attention to both climate mitigation impacts and adaptation and to linkages between climate and other policy areas 2 envisaged activities and anticipated outputs in the dialogue phase the dialogue will be science based policy dialogue each debate will be developed with input and presentations by participants themselves the participants will have had time to prepare input for the meeting and will not just be responding to the ideas of others participants will arrive at each meeting having prepared background note outlining their perspective on and answers to the research questions the scientists will adopt response mode starting with addressing questions tabled in the preparatory interviewsconsultations in response to the questions raised the scientists will prepare dedicated input for subsequent meetings the debates will be prepared by interviewing participants in advance of and after each dialogue session an independent person competent in organising such dialogue process and also conversant with the international negotiation process and the relevant scientific findings will chair the dialogue the chair will be supported by the project team in preparing and chairing the sessions and in drafting reports the envisaged dialogue set up will be based on series of linked two day workshops organised with 34 months intervals supported by short scientific briefings and presentations the writing of position papers reporting of outcomes based on chatham house rules and web site the design of the dialogue phase is however subject to the outcomes of the regional consultations in the preparatory phase see below the detailed design of the dialogue phase will be developed in phase 1 of the project the anticipated outputs of the dialogue process will focus on inter alia useful indicators for defining acceptable and unacceptable climate change impacts acceptable and unacceptable levels of climate change and related arguments and preconditions useful indicators for defining longterm climate policy goals costs and preconditions of various levels of adaptation and mitigation costs and acceptability of longterm climate policy goals implications of longterm climate policy goals for medium term post 2012 levels of ghg emission control and international climate change strategies we expect that these items will be covered in the following deliverables reports of individual dialogue sessions as approved by stakeholder participants not connecting specific names to views expressed in order to maintain the strict informal nature of the dialogue process summary report of the whole dialogue series highlighting important findings of participants and indicating notions that may be useful for the unfccc process as approved by stakeholder participants without making recommendations on what exactly constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system communications of stakeholder participants to national and international audiences of their personal experiences during the dialogue process presentations by the project team to various national and international audiences on the main findings of the dialogue series on the basis of the dialogue session and summary reports as approved by stakeholder participants web based communication of the dialogue session reports and all relevant scientific inputs in the dialogue process figure 1 overview of the hot project 3 preparatory phase key element of the preparatory phase will be the organisation of regional meetings in asia latin america africa and the annexi developed countries to consult on the design of the dialogue and the development of regional position papers on article 2 these meetings should allow for including specific regional perspectives on the issue of operationalisation of art 2 and also enhance the commitment of envisaged participants to participate in the dialogue phase of the project they will be organised by consortium partners in the various regions on the basis of common format for set up and reporting all participants in these consultations will be asked to prepare background note outlining their perspective on and answers to the research questions this will allow the dialogue to proceed smoothly and enable researchers to compare early and late positions to explore the learning process the results of the regional consultation and position papers will be used by the project team to design the dialogue and organise the scientific input for the dialogue phase that will be laid down in project proposal for the dialogue phase the following activities are envisaged in the preparatory phase 1 organisation of the consortiumproject management the successful conclusion of this project will require coordination amongst the partners to arrange the logistical details of the project 2 establishing rules of procedure and research protocol including selection of participants deepening contact to gain information regarding conditions for commitment and securing commitment in the writing of this project proposal contact has already been established with the partners in the consortium and some common understanding has been established once the project is approved the initial task will be to deepen this contact ensure that we are not only in agreement about the subject but also about the methodology to be used in this project and to develop common research protocol that helps each partner undertake his or her tasks effectively for the regional and international workshops it is important that we select stakeholders to ensure regional balance and representation see table 2 that the participants are constructive and are positive towards this project that we have good understanding of the conditions under which the stakeholders will be willing to participate in the process and that the project team is able and willing to meet these conditions in this stage we will define criteria for selection of participants consult with potential participants prepare short list of preferred participants for each region group contact participants to check their interest and secure written commitments from the participants to be engaged in this project each participant will be asked to prepare for the regional meeting by creating background note outlining their perspective on and answers to the research questions table 2 proposed matrix for

consultations on the views of the regional participants about the objective contents agenda setting information needs and envisaged outcomes and design of the dialogue structure approach process the preparatory phase will include an inventory of the questions and views of the policy stakeholders related to the various aspects of the issues at hand this will be accomplished by organising workshop with potential participants andor by interviewing other means of eliciting the key questions and views of stakeholders can be through an advance survey questionnaire conducted through email andor an electronic discussion forum this will help reach out to an audience wider than the eventual participants in the regional consultations in identifying participants for the preparatory phase we should make use of existing research networksgroups whose members are beginning to undertake research on postkyoto issues eg the ring network rngos research and independent ngos group the climate change knowledge network cicero csda sei wri iisd etc and others the information gathered will be used for elaborating the design of the dialogue the policy agenda of the first workshop and to select and guide scientists in preparing their input in particular we will secure information about the point of departure expectations and desired outcomes of stakeholders their initial level of knowledge and information needs potential points of conflict to be dealt with in the project design conditions for participation in order to enhance the commitment of participants to the project and feedback to the design of the dialogue this inventory will then be presented in four regional papers 4 elaboration of the dialogue design and organisation of the process support on the basis of available theoretical knowledge and lessons learnt from past experience eg cool we will develop the rudimentary ideas for the design of the dialogue this design will be discussed intensively with the consortium members and with the potential participants in the project the final design will take into account rules for promoting intercultural dialogue and communication process between the participants through process manager 5 organisation of the scientific support coreteam formation selection of roster of experts etc science will support the dialogue by providing credible information and by providing feedback on various options and preferences expressed the third assessment report of ipcc provides good starting point for an informed debate about various aspects of preventing dangerous climate change and attaining fair distribution of mitigation and adaptation costs it can be supplemented by more dedicated expert input based on the latest insights and new analytical work the scientific input should allow for diverging views within the science community including those dissenting from the ipcc tar with view to better understand the underlying issues the scientific input to the policy dialogue will be coordinated by prominent multidisciplinary research institutes in both the north and the south the tyndall institute uk and coppe brazil see under project partners the group of scientists to inform the policy stakeholder debates will be composed in such way that it represents broad set of regions ie it should include developing countries and countries with economies in transition and disciplines the group of scientists will form core panel that will address the questions and information needs identified during the meetings and provide concise written input to the workshops as well as state of the art presentations on selected subjects their statements will include points of general consensus points of disagreement and points where science is indecisive andor in need of further research depending on the information requests of the participants additional experts will be invited for specific input 6 establishment of an advisory group given the complexity of the project and its policyoriented character there is clear need for organising external guidance for the project management the settingup of this board will be part of the preparatory phase it is envisaged that the first meeting of the board will take place near the end of the preparatory phase of the project to give advice on the design of the project the project team will select board members invite members to participate in the project and organise an advisory board meeting 7 preparation of phase 2 of the project proposal and fund raising the activities in the preparatory phase are expected to be substantial and thorough we hope that the inventory of regional ideas along with the advice of the advisory board will lead to the development of comprehensive project proposal including dialogue manual for phase 2 we will also integrate activities in the first phase of the project to create adequate support among policy makers and the funding community so that the proposal is also successful in raising the resources needed to make it happen one possibility is the call for preproposals by mistra the swedish foundation for strategic environmental research which focuses on the theme of moving international climate negotiations forward mistra invites proposals for large integrated research programmes that are solutionoriented and involve the establishment of dialogue with decisionmakers projects are expected to start in january 2004 with first phase of 34 years the total funding level for the first phase is sek 50 mn planning grants sek 200000 250000 each will be provided during aprilseptember 2003 the last date for applications is 1 march 2003 having gone through the call for pre proposals we feel that this may be good opportunity to send the proposal for the

ground of stakeholder participation traditional scientific methods cannot deal with the question of defining acceptable risks since this is seen essentially as political choice within the context of post normal science where problems are urgent and uncertain and the stakes are high participatory integrated assessment is seen as the key method for determining high quality answers participation can increase the quality and legitimacy of science and improve the quality legitimacy and compliance pull of decision making participation to enhance the quality of science from scientific perspective stakeholder participation is claimed to enhance the quality of science according to funtowicz and ravetz 1990 the hazy boundaries between science and policy threaten the quality of science berk et 1999 30 in policy and politics science is exposed to games of power and abuse consequently the traditional scientific values such as independence integrity and its critical function towards society decline this concern is shared by woodhouse and nieusma who state the point is not whether values are present in expert knowledge of course they are but whether some peoples values are systematically overrepresented through access to and representation by expertise while others are systematically underrepresented professionalised expertise in the 20th century arguably has become captured to an indefensible extent by large organisations and by elite who run them and benefit disproportionately from them woodhouse and nieusma 2001 7980 funtowicz and ravetz note that the unstructured character of environmental problems makes it impossible for scientists to produce pure science since unambiguous scientific definitions of such problems are impossible the answer to the problem cannot be to restore the traditional function of science rather the sciencepolicy interaction should be made transparent by designing new rules of conduct the traditional methodologies of scientific research offer insufficient protection against the corruptions of reason which are encouraged in modern conditions even in our dealings with the world of nature we need methodology which both comprehends the issue of quality of information and also operationalises the degree of quality from the best to the worst otherwise we have at best only vague pronouncements to provide an alternative to the old faith in science as embodying the true and the good funtowicz and ravetz 1990 32 funtowicz and ravetz argue that new picture of science is required which they refer to as postnormal science postnormal science takes into account the uncertainties valueloadings and commitments that characterise contemporary policyrelated science ravetz 1999 648 postnormal science is participatory in that the review process not only includes peers from the same disciplinary area but also scientists working in related areas and policy stakeholders the participation of stakeholders in this so called extended peer review may help to bridge the gap between the way problem is defined by members of the scientific community and the daily experiences and practices of the actors who have to contribute to the solution funtowicz and ravetz 1992 1993 1994 taking into account the diversity of stakeholder views and perspectives can help prevent the misuse of science and restore its integrity berk et 1999 31 similar ideas can be found in the concept of transdisciplinarity gibbons et 1994 häberli et 2000 thompson klein et 2001 which advocates new mode of knowledge production that involves stakeholders in the formulation of complex problem and its potential solutions like postnormal science transdisciplinarity pleas for review process of knowledge that is extended to nonscientists in order to make knowledge more socially robust participation to increase the legitimacy of science the involvement of stakeholders in problemsolving processes also supportas the legitimacy of science the setting aside of the idea that science is objective and neutral goes hand in hand with questions about the legitimacy of science as the most important source of information for policy or as gieryn 1995 405 phrases it the cognitive authority of science jasanoff poses the question if science in the policy setting is always coloured by values then what role should scientists who are professionally committed to impartiality expect to play in decisionmaking jasanoff 1990 7 fischer 2000 argues that scientific experts advice has often failed to solve the most pressing problems at times scientists solutions have even turned problems into much bigger ones these failures often rest on normative neglect the discredited role of scientific expertise for policy support has favoured the attention for stakeholder involvement in order to increase sciences legitimacy irwin 1995 proposes citizen science in which citizens are actively involved in the formulation of environmental problems and solutions this is needed to better address the social and normative dimensions which according to irwin belong to the core of environmental problems in the field of policy analysis mayer 1997 45 signals participatory turn as means to reestablish the credibility of policy analysis on the assumption that it is possible and desirable to give ordinary people stakeholders citizens and laymen key role in policy analysis wynne 1996 74 in order to increase the legitimacy of the authority of knowledge pleas for recognition of the more substantive intellectual status of lay knowledges than is usually acknowledged this is not claim for intellectual superiority or even equivalence for lay knowledges but it does imply much greater interdependence than is conventionally recognised between what comes to be defined as lay and expert knowledge these arguments all rest on the assumption that every person who feels involved in policy matter is capable of reasoned judgement or as mason et 1983 125 phrase it an expert is not special kind of person but each person is special kind of expert especially with respect to his or her own problems participation to improve the legitimacy of democracy involvement of stakeholders in problemsolving and decisionmaking is also desirable from democratic perspective some political theorists argue that representative democracy as developed in the nineteenth century is increasingly ill suited to handle contemporary complex problems and risks fung and wright 2001 the involvement of technical experts in policymaking has expanded which serves as structural obstacle for the original democratic ideal and threatens the legitimacy of the political system fischer 1990 fischer 2000 beck 1992 in the theory of deliberative democracy the legitimacy of democracy derives from public deliberation dryzek 2000 bohman 1996 bohman and rehg 1997 laird 1993 held 1987 this relates to two central values of democracy popular sovereignty and political equality it is generally accepted that democracy is the outcome of an agreement among people who establish sovereignty based upon their popular and mutual consent all power within the sovereignty is allocated through this agreement rousseau 1968 referred to in webler and renn 1995 argued that sovereignty is composed of all citizens and requires input via public involvement to determine legitimate objectives by this reasoning participation is justified out of necessity citizens must engage in political affairs to keep the state alive for only through stakeholder participation and interaction in political affairs the general publics will can be generated from the plurality of particular wills webler and renn 1995 21 in order to guarantee political equality democracy must engender population of capable and socially responsible citizens stakeholder involvement in political affairs can increase citizens morale and intellect cf rousseau 1968 and js mill 1873 referred to in webler and renn 1995 in other words people learn democracy by becoming engaged in its workings webler and renn 1995 22 participation to enhance the quality of decisionmaking participation will not only legitimise the political system but will also improve the quality of reasoning and decisionmaking mayer 1997 mayer and geurts 1998 hisschemöller 1993 the quality of decisionmaking can be improved in several ways van der sluijs 2001 322 firstly participation stimulates the inclusion of all relevant viewpoints interests and information which helps to rule out overlooking something kickert et 1997 bohman 1996 secondly participation opens opportunities to make use of local knowledge fischer 2000 the lack of inclusion of such local knowledge has often been an important barrier to the legitimisation and implementation of environmental policies renn et 1995 kickert et 1997 finally participation can help to avoid socalled typeiii errors5 raiffa 1968 264 dunn 1988 151 type iii error occurs when certain information about problem is excluded and subsequently more or less right solution is found for the wrong problem in order to prevent the decisionmaking process from resulting in typeiii error pooled intelligence moore 1987 is needed in which the issue at stake undergoes process of problem structuring ie the confrontation evaluation and integration of as much contradictory information on the issue as possible hisschemöller and hoppe 1996 some restraints on participation in contrast to the claims in favour of participation some more reserved notions on stakeholder participation have been made 1 incapability of rational judgement mainstream argument in political theories of the early 20th century especially schumpeters view on democracy is that the average citizen is not capable of rational judgement on complex matters that go beyond the experiences of his daily life especially in matters which involve norms and values such as politics and many environmental problems schumpeter considers the policy preferences of citizens merely manipulable opinions which change with the issues of the day at best citizens will only be to limited extent rational if their own selfinterests are at stake schumpeter 1942 referred to in hisschemöller 1993 2 defence of selfinterests this connects with another reservation on participation which flows from the assumption that human beings are led by selfishness and greed this means that the more people involved who want to defend their interest the more difficult it will be to improve policies by means of participation social scientists have developed different concepts to illustrate the idea that stakeholders are most likely to defend their own shortterm interest and to free ride on collective goods this is mainly because of economic rationality the cost for social behaviour will usually outweigh the benefits one of these concepts is the nimby syndrome not in my back yard which refers to fervent local citizen opposition to siting proposals or landuse activities with potential adverse impacts rosa 1988 referred to in webler and renn 1995 27 4 objective selection criteria participation will furthermore be undesirable if there are criteria for objective selection of participants the number of potential participants and alternatives maybe infinite so if everyone would be allowed to join the process the debate may never end and decisionmaking becomes impossible berk et 1999 27 5 insufficient level of scientific knowledge another claim against participation relates to the assumption in pia that in order to participate effectively in policy debates on matters of environmental complexity stakeholder must have reasonable level of scientific knowledge research on environmental attitudes however shows that among the many explanations of how people come to take certain attitude towards an environmental issue scientific knowledge turns out to be the least significant another pessimistic view on the possibility of dialogue between stakeholders and scientists points to the observation that nonexperts have natural tendency to mistrust scientific or technological experts berk et 1999 28 6 aggravation of conflict interaction between stakeholders can be very unproductive as it tends to worsen conflict this is especially the case in situations where socalled winwin options appear to be absent berk et 1999 28 the cultural approach to environmental risk douglas and wildavski 1983 analyses environmental controversies as conflict between cultures such conflict is highly emotional and therefore hard to handle the opportunity to participate raises expectations among stakeholders this can be an obstacle for decisionmaking as these expectations cannot all be fulfilled 7 threat to democracy stakeholder participation can override existing legitimate decisionmaking processes cooke and kothari 2001 this is in line with van thijn who perceives tension between participatory policymaking and democracy as participation from target groups threatens the position of the parliament van thijn 1997 referred to in berk et 1999 27 and with burke 1968 referred to in webler and renn 1995 23 who argues that too much participation can even disrupt the operation of the social system 8 empowerment of the already powerful stakeholder participation can lead to decisions that reinforce the interests of the already powerful cooke and kothari 2001 this can also be characterised as the participation paradox seley 1983 referred to in berk et 1999 27 which means that for effective participation one needs power resources but these are not equally distributed over the affected population power resources include for example access to relevant information and voice loud enough to get heard by the decision makers weaker interests are in marginal position so participation facilities will not be of great help to them diverging views on participation it can be concluded from the previous sections that different views on participation exist which include different opinions on how participation can contribute to the quality of decisionmaking quality of science legitimacy of democracy et cetera table 1 summarises these differences in terms of arguments in favour of and arguments against stakeholder participation it should be noted that in the field of participatory integrated assessment rather than plea for stakeholder participation as blue print for successful assessment the arguments in favour are regarded as conditions that can improve its effectiveness the arguments against stakeholder participation rather than categorically rejecting stakeholder participation are considered pitfalls that may prevent participation from working arguments in favour ofarguments against participation participation quality of participation improvesparticipation does not science the quality of scienceimprove the quality of as the inclusion of science as stakeholders all different lack reasonable
