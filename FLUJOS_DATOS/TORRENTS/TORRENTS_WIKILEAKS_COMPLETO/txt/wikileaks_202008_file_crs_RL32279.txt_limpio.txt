updated january 8 2008 scott szymendera analyst in disability policy domestic social policy division primer on disability benefits social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi summary generally the goal of disability insurance is to replace portion of workers income should illness or disability prevent him or her from working individuals may receive disability benefits from either federal or state governments or from private insurers this report presents information on two components of federal disability benefits those provided through the social security disability insurance ssdi and the supplemental security income ssi programs the ssdi program is an insured program that provides benefits to individuals who have paid into the system and meet certain minimum work requirements the ssi program in contrast is meanstested program that does not have work or contribution requirements but restricts benefits to those who meet asset and resource limitations the ssdi program was enacted in 1956 and provides benefits to insured disabled workers under the full retirement age and to their spouses surviving disabled spouses and children in amounts related to the disabled workers former earnings in covered employment the ssi program which went into effect in 1974 is needsbased program that provides flat cash benefit assuring minimum cash income to aged blind and disabled individuals who have very limited income and assets to receive disability benefits under either program individuals must meet strict medical requirements for both ssdi and ssi disability benefits disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity sga by reason of medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or last at least 12 months generally the worker must be unable to do any kind of work that exists in the national economy taking into account age education and work experience both programs are administered through the social security administration ssa and therefore have similar application and disability determination processes although ssdi and ssi are federal programs both federal and state offices are used to determine eligibility for disability benefits ssa determines whether someone is disabled according to fivestep process called the sequential evaluation process where ssa is required to look at all the pertinent facts of particular case current work activity severity of impairment and vocational factors are assessed in that order an applicant may be denied benefits at any step in the sequential process even if the applicant may meet later criterion the ssdi program is funded through the social security payroll tax and revenues generated by the taxation of social security benefits portions of which are credited to separate disability insurance di trust fund in contrast the ssi program is funded through appropriations from general revenues this report will be

benefits social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi generally the goal of disability insurance is to replace portion of workers income should illness or disability prevent him or her from working individuals may receive disability benefits from either federal or state governments or from private insurers this report presents information on two components of federal disability benefits those provided through the social security disability insurance ssdi and the supplemental security income ssi programs1 the ssdi program is an insured program that provides benefits to individuals who have paid into the system and meet certain minimum work requirements the ssi program in contrast is meanstested program that does not have work or contribution requirements but individuals must meet the asset and resource limitations to receive disability benefits under either program individuals must meet strict medical requirements social security disability insurance the ssdi program is part of the old age survivors and disability insurance oasdi program administered by the social security administration ssa the disability insurance portion of oasdi was enacted in 1956 and provides benefits to disabled workers under age 65 and to their spouses surviving disabled spouses and children in amounts related to the disabled workers former earnings in covered employment the ssdi benefits like those of the old age and survivors insurance oasi are meant to replace income from work that is lost by incurring one of the risks the social program insures against funding for the ssdi and oasi programs is primarily through payroll tax levied on workers in jobs covered by social security and the benefits are based on an individuals career earnings at the end of october 2007 nearly 89 million disabled workers and their dependents were receiving ssdi benefits2 1 this paper was originally written by laura haltzel and updated by april grady and julie m whittaker 2 social security administration oasdi monthly statistics october 2007 washington gpo 2007 table 1 available on the website of the social security administration at httpwwwssagovpolicydocsstatcompsoasdi_monthly200710indexhtml crs2 supplemental security income the ssi program which went into effect in 1974 is meanstested program that provides cash payments assuring minimum income for aged blind or disabled individuals who have very limited income and assets3 this program is often referred to as program of last resort since individuals who apply for benefits also are required to apply for all other benefits to which they may be entitled such as social security retirement or disability benefits pensions or unemployment benefits although the ssi program is administered by ssa it is funded through general revenues not payroll taxes the federal benefit provided through this program unlike through the ssdi program is flat amount adjusted for other income the individual may have and is not related to prior earnings in addition to the federal ssi payment many states provide additional supplements to certain groups or categories of people at the end of october 2007 nearly 74 million individuals received federally administered ssi payments4 of these nearly 62 million were entitled to benefits on the basis of disability or blindness5 type of benefits and average benefit levels ssdi ssdi benefits are based on the workers past average monthly earnings indexed to reflect changes in national wage levels up to five years of the workers low earnings are excluded6 the benefits are adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index for workers cpiw benefits are also provided to dependents such as spouses or children subject to certain maximum family benefit limits disability benefits may be offset if the disabled worker is simultaneously receiving workers compensation or other public disability benefits in addition individuals who receive ssdi benefits also receive medicare benefits after 24 month waiting period at the end of november 2006 the average monthly ssdi benefit was 98020 for disabled workers 26090 for spouses of disabled workers and 29141 for 3 see crs report 94486 supplemental security income ssi fact sheet by scott szymendera and crs report rs20294 ssi income and resource limits fact sheet by scott szymendera 4 includes federally administered state supplementation ten states provide supplemental payments that are federally administered other states that provide supplemental payments administer them at the state level 5 social security administration ssi monthly statistics october 2007 washington gpo 2007 tables 1 and 2 available on the website of the social security administration at httpwwwssagovpolicydocsstatcompsssi_monthly200710indexhtml 6 the basic benefit formula for ssdi benefits is similar to the benefit formula for social security old age and survivors benefits the workers past annual covered earnings are indexed to reflect changes in national earnings levels formula which provides higher replacement rate for low earners is then applied to these averaged earnings crs3 children of disabled workers7 the average age of disabled worker beneficiary in 2006 was 521 years8 ssi the basic federal ssi benefit is the same for all beneficiaries in 2008 the maximum ssi payment also called the federal benefit rate regardless of age is 637 per month for an individual living independently or 956 per month for couple living independently federal ssi benefits are increased each year to keep pace with inflation as measured by the cpiw the monthly ssi benefit may be reduced if an individual has other income or receives inkind noncash support or maintenance however states may voluntarily supplement this payment to provide higher benefit level than that specified in federal law ssi recipients living alone or in household where all members receive ssi benefits are also automatically eligible for food stamps states have three options for determining medicaid eligibility for ssi recipients in 32 states and the district of columbia individuals who are eligible for ssi are automatically eligible for medicaid ssi recipients in seven states and the northern mariana islands are eligible but must complete separate application for medicaid eleven other states have the option to impose medicaid eligibility requirements that are more restrictive than ssi criteria individuals may receive ssdi ssi based on disability or blindness or age or both some may also receive other benefits the amount of the ssi benefit may be adjusted based on receipt of other income such as ssdi benefits the ssdi benefit is not reduced if the recipient also receives ssi benefits because ssdi is not means tested as figure 1 shows over the past several years the number of adults age 1864 receiving disabilityrelated social security benefits has increased faster than those receiving disabilityrelated ssi benefits or those receiving both types of benefits9 at the end of november 2006 the average monthly federally administered ssi payment amount was 46580 for all recipients 55170 for children under age 18 48160 for adults age 1864 and 38530 for adults age 65 and older10 7 social security administration oasdi monthly statistics october

disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity sga by reason of medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or last at least 12 months generally the worker must be unable to do any kind of work that exists in the national economy taking into account age education and work experience the definition of disability for disabled children receiving ssi benefits is slightly different from adults instead of demonstrating work limitations children are required to demonstrate that they have marked or severe functional limitation and in addition they are subject to slightly different criteria for the medical listings 10 continued 2007 table 7 available on the website of the social security administration at httpwwwssagovpolicydocsstatcompsssi_monthly200710indexhtml crs5 ssdi to be eligible for ssdi benefits worker must be 1 insured and 2 disabled according to the definition of disability to be insured they must have worked minimum amount of time in employment covered by social security similar to eligibility for oasi benefits however for disability benefits if an individual does not have 40 quarters of coverage generally about 10 years they must have one quarter of coverage one quarter of coverage is equal to 1050 in 2008 and indexed to the annual increase in wages for each year after 1950 or from age 21 up to the onset of disability in addition recency of work test requires the worker to have 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of disability generally five years of work in the last 10 workers under age 31 need to have credit in one half of the quarters during the period between when they attained age 21 and when they became disabled minimum of six quarters is required once an individuals application for ssdi benefits has been approved he or she will receive benefits after fivemonth waiting period from the time the disability began and will receive medicare coverage 24 months after ssdi benefits begin disability benefits will continue as long as the individual remains disabled or until he or she reaches the full retirement age currently age 65 and six months for workers born in 1940 when the benefits automatically convert to retired worker benefits according to law ssa periodically conducts continuing disability reviews or cdrs to determine whether the individual is still disabled how often the beneficiarys medical condition is reviewed depends on how severe it is and the likelihood it will improve the ssdi award notice explains when the first review is expected if medical improvement is expected the first review will be six to 18 months after first receiving disability benefits if medical improvement possible the case will be reviewed about every three years if medical improvement is unlikely the case will be reviewed only about once every five to seven years if the beneficiary has received ssdi benefits for at least 24 months medical review will not be initiated solely on account of work activity of the individuals whose ssdi benefits are terminated the majority are due to factors other than medical recovery in 2006 of the nearly 500000 disabled workers benefits that were terminated 444 were because of conversion to retirement benefits and 395 were due to the individuals death another 52 of those terminated had medical improvement while 71 had earnings from work above the substantial gainful activity earnings limit table 1 reasons for ssdi worker benefit termination 2005 number of percent of

benefits an individual must be at least 65 years old to receive ssi disability benefits an individual must meet the same definition of disability that applies under the ssdi program see the section below on the disability determination process to qualify for ssi benefits because of blindness an individual must have visual acuity of 20200 or less with the use of correcting lens in the persons better eye or tunnel vision of 20 degrees or less in addition to age disability or blindness an individual must meet income and resource tests to qualify for ssi benefits they must also 1 be citizen

united states11 3 apply for all other benefits to which they are entitled and 4 if they are disabled accept the vocational rehabilitation services that they are offered there is recency of work test for ssi benefits as there is for ssdi benefits the countable resource limit for ssi eligibility is 2000 for individuals and 3000 for couples these amounts are not indexed for inflation and have remained at their current levels since 1989 some resources are not counted in determining eligibility for ssi among the excluded resources are an individuals home car used for essential transportation or if not essential up to 4500 of its current value property essential to incomeproducing activity household goods and personal effects totaling 2000 or less burial funds of 1500 or less and life insurance policies with total face value of 1500 or less two types of income are considered for purposes of determining ssi eligibility and payment amounts earned and unearned earned income includes wages net earnings from selfemployment and earnings from services performed most other income not derived from current work including social security benefits other government and private pensions veterans benefits workers compensation and inkind support and maintenance is considered unearned inkind support and maintenance includes food clothing or shelter that is given to an individual if an individual or couple meets all other ssi eligibility requirements their monthly ssi payment equals the maximum ssi benefit minus countable income not all income is counted for ssi purposes and different exclusions apply to earned and unearned income monthly unearned income exclusions include general income exclusion of 20 per month that applies to non needsbased income food stamps housing and energy assistance state and local needsbased assistance inkind support and maintenance from nonprofit organizations student grants and 11 ssi benefits are not available to residents of puerto rico guam or the united states virgin islands residents of these jurisdictions are eligible to receive federal benefits from their commonwealth or territorial government under provisions of title xiv and title xvi of the social security act these benefits are administered by the department of health and human services crs7 scholarships used for educational expenses and income used to fulfill plan for achieving selfsupport pass are also excluded from unearned income once the 20 exclusion and any other applicable exclusion is applied to unearned income there is each dollar for dollar reduction in ssi benefits each dollar of countable unearned income reduces the ssi benefit by one dollar monthly earned income exclusions include any unused portion of the 20 general income exclusion the first 65 of earnings onehalf of earnings over 65 impairmentrelated expenses for blind and disabled workers and income used to fulfill pass as result of the onehalf exclusion for earnings once the 65 exclusion and any other applicable exclusion is applied to earned income ssi benefits are reduced by 1 for every 2 of earned income in 2008 the monthly earned income amount at which an individual with unearned income and special earned income exclusions longer qualifies for federal ssi payment not including any state supplement is 1359 also called the earned income breakeven amount the monthly earned income amount at which couple longer qualifies is 1997 the earned income breakeven amount may be lower for ssi recipients with unearned income and those who do not live independently it may be higher for those who receive special earned income exclusions related to pass or to work in some cases the income and resources of nonrecipients are counted in determining ssi eligibility and payment amounts this process is called deeming and is applied in cases where an ssieligible child lives with an ineligible parent an eligible individual lives with an ineligible spouse or an eligible noncitizen has sponsor in contrast to ssdi the majority of adults who have their ssi disability benefits terminated are terminated because of having too much income unlike ssdi benefits ssi benefits may be suspended for one month and paid in the next depending on an individuals income or resources12 table 2 shows ssi recipients who had their benefits terminated for both ssdi and ssi recipients age 1864 less than

2004 washington gpo 2005 table 61 disability determination process the application process for ssdi and ssi disability benefits is very much the same13 although ssdi and ssi are federal programs both federal and state offices are used to determine eligibility for benefits an individual applies for benefits at local social security administration office where they are interviewed to obtain relevant medical and work history and to see that required forms are completed the case may be denied at that point because the applicant does not have ssdi insured status or is earning too much money from work work above the sga earnings limit in the case of social security disability cases or is above the income and resource limits in the case of ssi disability cases otherwise it is forwarded to the state disability determination service dds for medical determination the medical determination for both types of disability benefits is made on the basis of evidence gathered in the individuals case file ordinarily there is personal interview with the applicant on the part of the state personnel who decide the claim ssa determines whether someone is disabled according to fivestep process called the sequential evaluation process where ssa is required to look at all the pertinent facts of particular case current work activity severity of impairment and vocational factors are assessed in that order an applicant may be denied benefits at any step in the sequential process even if the applicant may meet later criterion for example worker that meets the medical listings for disability but earns an amount exceeding the sga earnings limit would be denied benefits at step 1 the five steps are as follows 13 for additional information see crs report rl33374 social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi the disability determination and appeals process by scott szymendera crs9 step 1 work test is the individual working and earning over sga 940 per month for nonblind individual or 1570 per month for blind individual in 2008 if yes the application is denied if the application moves to step 2 step 2 severity test is the applicants condition severe enough to limit basic life activities for at least one year if yes the application moves to step 3 if not the application is denied step 3 medical listings test does the condition meet ssas medical listings or is the condition equal in severity to one found on the medical listings14 if yes the application is accepted and benefits are awarded if the application moves to step 4 step 4 previous work test can the applicant do the work he or she had done in the past if yes the application is denied if not the application moves to step 515 step 5 any work test does the applicants condition prevent him or her from performing any other work that exists in the national economy if yes the application is accepted and benefits are awarded if the application is denied program financing information the ssdi program is primarily funded through the social security payroll tax portion of which is credited to separate disability insurance di trust fund by contrast the ssi program is funded through appropriations from general revenues ssdi the payroll tax is 153 tax on earnings that is split equally between employees and employers payroll tax revenues are used to pay benefits under the social security oasdi program and the medicare hospital insurance hi program the social security portion of the payroll tax is 124 62 each per employee and employer on earnings up to the taxable maximum 102000 in 2008 of the 124 106 is paid to the oasi trust fund and 18 is paid to the di trust fund in addition to these payroll tax contributions the di trust fund receives some revenue from the taxation of social security benefit payments these combined revenues are 14 the medical listings can be found in the social security administration publication disability evaluation under social security available at httpwwwssagovdisability professionalsbluebookentirepublication12005pdf this publication is commonly referred to as the ssa blue book hereafter cited as ssa blue book 15 cases of children applying for ssi benefits are not subject to the work test but instead to test of functional capacity crs10 invested in nonmarketable government bonds which earned an effective annual interest rate of 53 in 200716 the resources in the di trust fund are used to pay ssdi benefits currently the di trust fund is running surplus as revenues coming into the trust fund exceed benefits paid out under current projections this trend will continue for the next nine years but after that the program expenditures are projected to exceed its revenues leading to the exhaustion of the di trust fund in 2026 in contrast the oasi trust fund will be depleted in 2042 and taken together the oasdi trust fund will be depleted in 204117 among other things the rapid rise in expenditures will be reflection of the aging of the baby boom as more of them are projected to apply for ssdi benefits when they reach ages 5065 at which higher rates of disability incidents occur ssi the ssi program is financed through the general revenue of the united states each year congress appropriates money to pay both ssi benefits and administrative costs the ssi appropriation for fy2006 was 40203 million with 37340 million going to pay ssi benefits and 2863 million going to pay for program administration vocational rehabilitation and research18 16 data taken from the social security
