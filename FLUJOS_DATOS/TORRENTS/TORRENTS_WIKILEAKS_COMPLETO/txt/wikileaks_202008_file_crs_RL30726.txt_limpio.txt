domestic social policy division prescription drug coverage under medicaid summary medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for services on behalf of certain groups of lowincome persons one of its most important benefits is prescription drug coverage as of january 2006 many of medicaids elderly and disabled beneficiaries began receiving their drug coverage under medicare nonetheless medicaid continues to be an important source of funding in the nations pharmaceutical markets and medicaid drug coverage an important source of drugs for many lowincome and disabled medicaid beneficiaries outpatient prescription drug coverage under medicaid is an optional benefit if states choose to cover prescription drugs they must be provided to medicaid enrollees who are categorically needy that is to individuals who qualify for medicaid on the basis of being in certain groups in addition states have the option of choosing to provide prescription drug coverage to medically needy individuals persons who are not poor by cash welfare standards but who require help with medical expenses thirtythree states and the district of columbia provide prescription drug coverage to all medicaid beneficiaries prescription drug benefits under medicaid are very broad states can create formularies or lists of preferred benefits but certain federal rules keep actual coverage very comprehensive even in medicaid managed care organizations which are not subject to those rules current practice ensures generous drug benefit there are 11 categories of prescription drugs that states are allowed to exclude from coverage based on state financial reports for 2005 payments for medicaid outpatient prescription drugs net of all rebates federally required rebates plus state supplemental rebates were 307 billion accounting for just over 10 of payments for all medicaid services since 1990 pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are covered by state medicaid programs are required to rebate portion of states payments for their products states reported collecting total of 111 billion in federal rebates and an additional 13 billion in state supplemental rebates on prescription drugs in 2005 on average in 2005 perperson spending for medicaid drugs was just over 1500 the deficit reduction act of 2005 made number of changes to the programs rules primarily relating to the financing of drugs the definition of average manufacturers price amp and the cost sharing amounts that states are able to require medicaid beneficiaries to pay for these drugs cms regulations

medicaid introduction medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical services on behalf of certain groups of lowincome persons it is the third largest social program in the federal budget exceeded only by social security and medicare and is typically the second largest spending item for states the federal share of medicaid costs in fy2005 for benefits and administration is estimated to have been 180 billion1 states are estimated to have spent an additional 136 billion for total program cost of 316 billion medicaid programs are administered and designed by the states under broad federal guidelines states must provide medicaid to certain population groups and have the option of covering others similarly state must cover certain basic services and may cover additional services if it chooses states set their own payment rates for services with some limitations there is thus considerable variation in medicaid programs with some relatively limited and others very generous in terms of eligible populations covered benefits and payments for services medicaid is meanstested program enrollees income and other resources2 must be within program financial standards these standards vary among states and among different population groups within state with some exceptions medicaid is available only to persons with very low incomes most medicaid enrollees have income that is below the poverty level with number of exceptions medicaid is available only to children adult members of families with children pregnant women and to persons who are aged blind or disabled persons not falling into those categories such as single adults and childless couples generally cannot qualify matter how low their income is3 the various eligibility groups have traditionally been divided into two basic classes the categorically needy and the medically needy the two terms once distinguished between welfarerelated categorically needy beneficiaries and those qualifying only under special medicaid rules which allow states to cover persons whose income is too high to qualify for cash welfare support but who nevertheless need help with medical bills medically needy however nonwelfare groups have 1 preliminary fy2005 cms form 64 financial reports 2 resources include bank accounts and similar liquid assets as well as real estate automobiles and other personal property whose value exceeds specified limits and usually exclude an individuals primary residence 3 several states use special waivers of medicaids eligibility rules to extend coverage to other groups of individuals not traditionally eligible crs2 been added to the categorically needy list over the years as result the terms are longer especially helpful in sorting out the various populations for whom mandatory or optional medicaid coverage has been made available however the distinction remains important when considering certain benefits some benefits are considered mandatory for categorically needy individuals that is states must cover those benefits for the categorically needy but they are optional for medically needy individuals other benefits including prescription drugs are optional for both groups of beneficiaries some states provide those optional benefits only to categorically needy individuals some states provide those benefits to both groups and some provide those benefits to certain subcategories of medically needy as well as categorically needy see table 1 several recent laws have had and will continue to have major impact on medicaid prescription drug benefits while specific provisions will be discussed in detail below summary of those major changes that affect prescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries are as follows the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra 2005 pl 109171 changed the federal upper limit applying to payments for most generic drugs under the medicaid program required that manufacturerreported average manufacturer prices be publically available included provisions intended to improve states ability to collect drug rebates for physicianadministered and authorized generic drugs and liberalized states ability to establish copayments on prescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries the medicare prescription drug improvements and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 established the part d medicare benefit effective january 1 2006 all beneficiaries who are eligible for both medicaid benefits and medicare benefits will receive their drug coverage under the new medicare part d and established formula to continue the states contribution for the cost of prescription drugs provided to dually eligible beneficiaries whose drug coverage moved from medicaid to medicare upon implementation of part d other recent activity includes provision passed in pl 11028 the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act of 2007 that would require all paper medicaid prescriptions to be written on tamperresistant pads subsequent legislation pl 11090 tma abstinence education and qi programs extension act of 2007 however delayed crs3 its implementation through march 31 2008 in addition cms rules4 intended to define the way the amp is to be calculated under dra have been challenged5 and cms has been enjoined from implementing the changed rules until the courts deliberation is complete prescription drug benefits coverage of outpatient prescription drugs is optional for state medicaid programs states choose whether or not to include coverage of outpatient drugs in their medicaid benefit package in 2005 all states covered outpatient prescription drugs for at least some medicaid beneficiaries well more than half of the states reported covering outpatient drugs for all medicaid beneficiaries the remaining states covered drugs for at least categorically needy individuals table 1 and sometimes for other specified groups in addition to the categorically needy prescription drug coverage is one of the few optional medicaid services provided by all states this is in part due to the belief that coverage of prescription drug benefits is good deal that the provision of this benefit can help to keep enrollees healthier and potentially prevent more serious andor costly medical interventions table 1 medicaid coverage of outpatient

cms1102405 note arizona and tennessee provide pharmaceutical coverage to all beneficiaries through programs operated under section 1115 demonstration waivers these programs do not recognize the federal distinction between categorically and medically needy feeforservice coverage for medicaid beneficiaries who are not enrolled in medicaid managed care plans federal statute allows states to establish formularies formularies are lists of preferred pharmaceuticals when health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others the list is referred to as closed formulary medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the private market for insurance because of two statutory requirements the first requirement is that states must cover any non formulary drug with the exception of drugs in 11 specific categories see below crs5 that is specifically requested and approved through prior authorization process6 the second requires states to cover all drugs offered by manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the secretary of health and human services hhs while ensuring that medicaid formularies are not too restrictive federal statute does section 1927d of medicaid law on the other hand clearly allow states to exclude the following categories of drug products from medicaid coverage drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote fertility c for cosmetic purposes or hair growth d for the relief of coughs and colds for smoking cessation and f prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines7 j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that can only be provided by the drug manufacturer and k for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction unless such agents are used to treat condition other than sexual or erectile dysfunction for which the agents have been approved by the food and drug administration formularies may also exclude drug for which there is significant therapeutic advantage over other drugs that are included in the formularies as long as there is written explanation of the reason for its exclusion and the explanation is available to the public managed care coverage for medicaid beneficiaries who are enrolled in managed care plans plans to which states pay fixed monthly payment in exchange for the provision all or some subset of covered services medicaid statute includes broad exception to the drug coverage rules described above8 the law allows the enrolling managed care organization to develop and administer its own formulary in practice however when prescription drugs are covered under the managed care arrangement states enforce limitations on the formularies of managed care entities similar to those imposed on states by the federal government this policy was initiated in correspondence from the secretary of health and human services hhs to state medicaid directors9 this letter notified states that drugs covered under the state plan must also be made available in medicaid managed care formularies for medicaid managed care enrollees states generally establish contract clauses in their agreements with medicaid health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care organizations mcos that allow such entities to establish formularies but also require them to meet all of the feeforservice coverage rules overthecounter otc medications many state medicaid programs also cover otc medications or those medications that can be purchased without prescription survey conducted by the national pharmaceutical council npc questions states about medicaid coverage of eight categories of nonprescription drugs allergy asthma and sinus medications analgesics cough and cold medicines 6 prior authorization is process whereby patients provider requests approval for coverage from the medicaid agency or its contractor of specific drug before dispensing that drug 7 barbiturates and benzodiazepines are drugs generally used as sedatives and tranquilizers 8 section 1927j of the social security act 9 coverage

categories allergy asthma and sinus analgesics cough and cold smoking deterrents digestive products h2antagonists feminine products and topical products11 in general medicaid pharmaceutical benefits are very broad encompassing most prescription drugs and many nonprescription drugs medicaid beneficiaries receiving care in the feeforservice sector are assured of broad pharmaceutical coverage due to statutory requirements that prohibit states with closed formularies from denying drugs requested and approved in the prior authorization process and those offered by manufacturers that have rebate agreements in effect the benefits provided to medicaid managed care enrollees tend to be similarly broad because of administrative policies state medicaid programs have undergone major changes in their drug coverage policies over the past few years in response to the implementation of medicare prescription drug coverage part d under the provisions of the mma 2003 and as of january of 2006 medicare part d replaced medicaid as the primary insurer for most drugs for dual eligible beneficiaries medicaid programs are specifically prohibited from continuing to cover drugs offered under the medicare plans but may however cover those drugs not included in part d coverage state medicaid programs will continue to be required to contribute to the cost of drugs now covered under medicare part d however based on formula specified in mma 2003 the formula requires states to contribute an amount equal to 90 declining to 75 of the per capita cost of states drug spending under medicaid in 2003 multiplied by the number of dual eligibles enrolling in the new medicare benefit12 in addition medicaid administrations are required to conduct eligibility determinations for individuals qualifying for assistance with copays under part d prescription drugs pricing policies and rebates medicaid drug payments and federal upper limits medicaids payments to pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs have two components an amount to cover the cost of the ingredients the acquisition cost and an amount to cover the pharmacists professional services in filling and dispensing 10 one state

httpwwwnpcnoworgresourcespdfsmedicaid20050506 section4pdf 12 see crs report rl32902 medicare prescription drug benefit lowincome provisions by jennifer osullivan for more details crs7 the prescription the dispensing fee medicaid law requires the secretary to establish upper limits on the federal share of payments for acquisition costs that are designed to encourage the substitution of lowercost generic equivalents for more costly brand name drugs those limits apply separately to multiple source drugs defined to include any drug for which there is at least one other drug sold and marketed during the period that is rated as therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent to it and to all other drugs fuls for multiple source drugs when applied to multiple source drugs the limits are referred to as the fuls which stands for federal upper limits the fuls do not apply to individual claims for prescription drugs rather the limits are applied in the aggregate to each states spending for particular drug the dra 2005 signed by the president on february 8 2006 made several significant changes to the ful policy for multiple source drugs the provision of law became effective on january 1 2007 new fuls however have not yet been issued by cms as result the fuls in effect today are based on formulas in prior law the fuls are calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and are periodically published in the state medicaid manual13 under the deficit reduction act of 2005 new fuls issued after january 1 2007 are required to be equal to 250 of the average manufacturer price amp of the least costly therapeutic equivalent computed without regard to prompt pay discounts14 the amp is reported to cms by manufacturers and is defined in statute to be the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade15 under the ful policy each state must assure the secretary that its medicaid spending for multiple source drugs is in accordance with the upper limits plus reasonable dispensing fees the effect of this requirement is that when lowercost generic equivalent exists for brandname drug pharmacy will be paid at price tied to the least costly alternative even if the brandname drug is actually furnished the medicaid program as well as the pharmacy supplying the drug therefore has financial incentive to see that lowercost generic equivalents are substituted for their brandname counterparts 13 42 cfr 447331447332 14 the fuls in effect today as calculated under prior law are equal to 150 of the published price for the least costly therapeutic equivalent cms uses average wholesale prices awps as the basis for the formula those figures are published annually in compendia by the pharmaceutical industry 15 new fuls taking into account changes passed in dra are not likely to be issued soon this is because regulations issued in july of 2007 describing the methodology for calculating amp an important component of the fuls as required by dra have been enjoined from being implemented pending legal challenge brought by the national association of chain drug stores and the national community pharmacists association they contend that the regulation goes beyond congressional intent and would cause harm if implemented crs8 the upper limit for multiple source drugs does not apply if physician provides handwritten certification on the prescription that specific brand is medically necessary for particular recipient the brand name would then be dispensed subject to the limits applicable to other drugs upper limits for all other drugs all other drugs include single source or brandname drugs and multiple source drugs for which specific ful limit has not yet been established the upper limit that applies to other drugs is the lower of the estimated acquisition cost eac plus reasonable dispensing fee or the providers usual and customary charge to the general public the eac is the state medicaid agencys best estimate of the price generally paid by pharmacies and other providers to acquire the drug states may use any payment method as long as in the aggregate states payments for other drugs are below the payment levels determined by applying the upper limit for other drugs states payment formulas while states must ensure that federal matching funds do not pay for drug prices that exceed the upper limits described above there are other rules on how states set their payment formulas for drugs for most medicaid drugs many states use payment formulas that are based on published retail prices known as average wholesale prices awps16 less some percentage table 2 although this may change following the full implementation of dra 2005 the formulas below represent states attempt to estimate the true acquisition costs that retailers pay to wholesalers to obtain the pharmaceuticals they sell while awps are used by the states to estimate those acquisition costs it is believed that the published awps are more like manufacturers suggested wholesale prices rather than true measure of the average costs to pharmacies of obtaining pharmaceuticals in reality many drug wholesalers compete with each other by offering pharmacies different discounts from awp and some pharmacies purchase their drugs directly from the manufacturers skipping wholesalers entirely17 16 awps are intended to represent the average price at which wholesalers sell drug product to retail pharmacies they are compiled annually in industry compendia

acquisition cost smac state maximum allowable cost another provision in dra 2005 requires the secretary of hhs to make manufacturers reported amp data available on monthly basis to states and to post those amounts with at least quarterly updates on website accessible to the public the availability of such data which cms plans to make available in the spring of 2007 may encourage states to make changes to their drug reimbursement formulas based on amps instead of awps there are few reasons why states may want to make this change first basing reimbursements on the same measure of price that the fuls are based on could help to ensure that the ceilings are not exceeded second the amps unlike the awps will presumably be calculated in consistent crs11 fashion once proposed regulations defining those calculation become finalized18 in addition amps are subject to the oversight and review of the secretary of hhs dispensing fees dispensing fees the amounts paid to pharmacies to cover the cost of dispensing the prescription medication are only limited insofar as they must be reasonable most such fees generally range from around 350 per prescription to 500 per prescription although fees may be higher in states that do not use flat fee until only recently few states varied professional dispensing fees today dispensing fees in many states vary most often with higher fees paid for generics than for single source drugs in few states the fees vary by urbanrural location or based on the pharmacys historical operating cost and volume medicaid drug rebates an important feature of medicaids best price drug payment policy was created in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 that law requires drug manufacturers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under the agreements pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid for medicaid beneficiaries the formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs in return for entering into agreements with the secretary state medicaid programs are required to cover all of the drugs marketed by those manufacturers with possible exceptions for the 11 categories of drugs that states are allowed to exclude from coverage in 2003 there were reported to have been more than 550 manufacturers participating in the medicaid drug rebate program19 rebate requirements do not apply to drugs dispensed by medicaid managed care organizations when the drugs are paid as part of the mcos capitation rate and to drugs provided in hospitals and sometimes in physicians or dentists offices or similar settings20 rebate requirements on the other hand do apply to prescription drugs provided on feeforservice basis as well as to nonprescription items such as aspirin when they are prescribed for medicaid beneficiary and covered under the states medicaid plan the rebates are computed and remitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers each quarter based on utilization information supplied by the state programs states 18 proposed rules were published on friday december 22 2006 42 cfr 447 medicaid program prescription drugs 19 testimony of dennis smith director center for medicaid and state operations centers for medicare and medicaid services before the energy and commerce committee subcommittee on oversight and investigations december 7 2004 20 the general rule here is that rebates apply to drugs when they are billed separately and not when their costs are embedded in claim for another service crs12 collect the rebates from the manufacturers the federal share of the rebates are subtracted from states claims for their federal share of program costs in setting the amount of required rebates the law distinguishes between two classes of drugs the first includes single source drugs generally those still under patent and innovator multiple source drugs drugs originally marketed under patent or original new drug application nda but for which generic competition now exists the second class includes all other noninnovator multiple source drugs generics table 3 shows the requirements applicable to the two different classes of drugs these are discussed in further detail below single source and innovator multiple source drugs manufacturers are required to pay state medicaid programs basic rebate for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the amp for drug to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler retailer nonprofit or public entity21 the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufacturers single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers prices in effect on october 1 1990 are used as base and are compared with prices in the month before the start of the period for which the rebate is to be issued to determine if current prices have risen faster than inflation22 since 1990 there have been few changes to the medicaid drug rebate policy before 1992 best price was defined to exclude drugs sold to federal agencies at depot prices23 and single award contract prices under the veterans health care act of 1992 pl 102585 prices charged by manufacturers to certain federal agencies were also excluded from the determination of best price these agencies include the department of veterans affairs dva the department of defense dod the public health service phs and various phsfunded health programs and state nonmedicaid pharmaceutical assistance programs the exclusion of those prices from the best price potentially reduced medicaid savings from the rebate program so congress responded with an offset rebate percentages were increased to those 21 for the purposes of determining medicaid rebates prices paid by number of federal and state entities are excluded from the definition of the best price these are discussed in further detail below 22 us department of health and human services office of the inspector general medicaid drug price comparisons average manufacturer price to published prices oei 050500240 june 2005 other comparative pricing analyses can be found in us government

table 3 mma 2003 further excludes the prices of drugs provided under medicare part d from best price that legislation however did not include an offsetting rebate adjustment the veterans health care act also provides as condition of medicaid reimbursement for manufacturers drugs that the manufacturer enter into separate agreement with the secretary to provide discounts and rebates to certain phsfunded entities with public disproportionate share hospitals as well as new discount agreement with dva24 noninnovator multiple source drugs for noninnovator multiple source drugs basic rebates are equal to 11 of the amp prices offered to other payers are not considered nor is there any additional rebate for excess price increases table 3 medicaid rebate formulas single source and innovator

as measured additional rebate by the cpiu na source 42 usc sec 1396r8 in 2005 the total amount of federally required drug rebates was reported by states to be 111 billion states also reported collecting more than 13 billion in supplemental rebates not required by the federal government although there is reason to believe that reported amounts for state supplemental rebates are too low see the discussion on page 16 on average federal rebates represented about 26 of medicaid spending on outpatient prescription drugs rebates for 2005 by state are reflected in table 4 24 even before the

capitated arrangements since drugs are included in the capitation payment to mcos rebates do not apply drug pricing and rebate issues average wholesale prices the dra 2005 addressed concerns that had been raised repeatedly in the last several years regarding the awps and the states and hhss reliance on those prices for setting pharmaceutical payment levels and fuls today fuls are calculated based on the published awps however congressional hearings and investigations by the general accounting office and the office of the inspector general ig of health and human services hhs found that the awps do not reflect the intended wholesale prices and that some manufacturers manipulated the published awps to offer discounts to certain purchasers without offering those prices to medicaid25 by replacing the ful computation with formula based on amps the use of awps for setting medicaid drug prices may become thing of the past in addition dra 2005 allows the secretary to gather data on retail drug prices once implemented dras data reporting provisions may prove to be useful for determining whether the upper limits on drug prices are too high too low or adequate circumventing the best price or rebate policies second area that has raised concerns relates to the best prices that are reported by manufacturers to cms and are used by cms to calculate rebates there have been cases in which manufacturers sell drugs or report drug prices in ways that circumvent medicaids rebate requirement or minimize rebates to be paid for example manufacturers could skirt the best price requirement by selling finished drugs to certain favored hmos at large discounts and claiming that they have been sold to repackagers or redistributors since drugs sold by repackagers or redistributors are not subject to 25 us congress house committee on government reform correspondence to representative henry waxman ranking minority member from june gibbs brown inspector general dept of health and human services november 22 1999 crs16 medicaids rebate requirements rebates are avoided in 1999 the inspector general estimated the lost rebate for one repackaged drug at over 25 million in one year26 in addition recently schering plough corporation agreed to pay 293 million to resolve its liabilities in connection with fraudulent pricing of its allergy drug claritin under the medicaid drug rebate program schering plough allegedly failed to include the value of certain incentives offered to two managed care organizations in the best price reported for purposes of the medicaid drug rebate program the resulting charge was that medicaid rebates were underpaid and other entities such as community health centers that purchase drugs at ceiling prices that are based on medicaid drug rebate prices were overcharged27 dra 2005 intervened to address another concern related to the collection of rebates on certain drugs the ig and cms have both raised the concern that some rebates have gone unpaid for certain drugs administered by physicians in their offices or in another outpatient setting such as chemotherapy simply due to operational gaps this is because providers use healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs jcodes to bill the medicaid program for injectible prescription drugs including cancer drugs the hcpcs jcodes do not however provide states with the specific manufacturer information necessary to enable them to seek rebates in letter to state medicaid directors cms requested that states identify medicaid drugs specifically those using hcpcs jcodes by their ndc codes so that rebates can be collected for these drugs smdl 03002 dated march 14 2003 nonetheless dra 2005 stepped in to require as condition of receiving medicaid payments that states submit to the secretary of hhs utilization data and coding information for certain physicianadministered outpatient drugs such data would be required initially for all single source drugs administered by physicians later the same data would be required for the 20 physicianadministered multiple source drugs with the highest dollar volume as determined by the secretary finally the dra included provision intended to improve best price reporting for authorized generic drugs sometimes manufacturers produce both brandname version of prescription drug and also sell or

and use prior authorization states use number of techniques to control cost andor use of pharmaceuticals one of those techniques is prior authorization under prior authorization requirement only those pharmaceutical products that have been approved in advance by designated individual or entity are covered states may establish prior authorization programs under medicaid for all drugs or for certain classes of drugs as long as these programs meet two criteria 1 they must respond within 24 hours to request for approval and 2 they must dispense at least 72 hour supply of covered drug in emergency situations in 2005 all including the district of columbia but one state reports having prior authorization procedure for at least some covered drugs but little information is available describing the number or types of drugs those states require to undergo such review33 some pharmaceutical industry representatives and consumer advocates have voiced opposition to states use of prior authorization programs they claim such programs are burdensome are not cost effective and are becoming increasingly 30 the bill language doesnt use the term authorized generic instead it requires the reported prices to include the price of any drug sold under new drug application approved under section 505c of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca by fda 31 supplemental rebates are required to be

control the use of outpatient prescription drugs and all have programs in place to assess the quality of their pharmaceutical programs the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 included requirement that all states implement drug use review dur programs and provided for enhanced federal matching payment to cover the costs of conducting those dur activities dur programs are aimed at both improving the quality of pharmaceutical care and assisting in containing costs the major features of dur programs are enhanced communication between pharmacists and beneficiaries upon dispensing prescriptions ongoing retrospective review of prescribing practices educational outreach for pharmacists physicians and beneficiaries and pharmacy counseling cost sharing requirements for medicaid prescription drugs in addition to prior authorization and utilization review many medicaid programs impose cost sharing requirements on enrollees to control drug use and spending cost sharing is another area that dra 2005 made significant changes to that could impact prescription drug benefits for medicaid beneficiaries predra 2005 cost sharing limitations prohibited states from requiring copayments on services provided to children under age 18 pregnant women for any services that relate to the pregnancy or to any medical condition that may complicate pregnancy and people who are hospitalized or residing in longterm care facility in addition copayments could not be charged for people receiving hospice emergency34 and family planning services any copayments charged for other beneficiaries or benefits were limited to nominal amounts35 34 states may obtain waiver of this rule to impose up to twice the nominal amount established for outpatient services for services received at hospital emergency room if the services are not emergency services as long as they have established to the satisfaction of the secretary that beneficiaries have alternative sources of nonemergency outpatient services that are available and accessible 35 nominal amounts are defined in 42 cfr 44752 54 dra 2005 changed the definition of nominal amounts so that beginning with fy2006 those amounts will be indexed by inflation as estimated using the medical care component of the consumer price index crs21 dra 2005 created two optional cost sharing plans that states could choose to implement as alternatives to the cost sharing limitations described above under the new cost sharing options both of which became effective on march 31 2006 states are prohibited from requiring cost sharing for certain medicaid beneficiaries the list of those that must remain exempt from cost sharing is slightly different from the list of those exempt under prior law states will be prohibited from imposing cost sharing for 1 services provided to mandatory children who are under age 18 or are in foster care under part b of title iv or are receiving adoption or foster care assistance under title ive regardless of age 2 preventive services provided to children under 18 regardless of family income 3 services provided to pregnant women that relate to pregnancy or to other medical conditions that may complicate pregnancy 4 services provided to terminally ill individuals receiving medicaid hospice 5 services provided to individuals in medical institutions who are required to spend their income down to qualify for medicaid 6 emergency services 7 family planning services and supplies and 8 services provided to women qualifying for medicaid under the breast and cervical cancer eligibility group the first new cost sharing option under dra 2005 allows states to establish cost sharing amounts that exceed nominal amounts and to vary those amounts among classes or groups of individuals or by types of services the second option which applies specifically to outpatient prescription drugs allows states to establish cost sharing plan under which beneficiaries are charged higher cost sharing amounts for stateidentified nonpreferred drugs and or reduced cost sharing amounts for preferred drugs the two new options come with additional limitations besides the groups that are specifically exempted as described above the dra 2005 cost sharing amounts cannot exceed 10 of the cost of the item or service for individuals with income between 100 and 150 of poverty and 20 of the cost of the item or service for individuals with an income over 150 of poverty in addition an aggregation of all cost sharing amounts cannot exceed 5 of family income table 6 shows copayment requirements as of march of 2007 these amounts are not likely to reflect the full impact of the dra flexibilities since those provisions became effective at the end of that month states that require copayments for covered

the average annual growth in drug spending under medicaid over the 15 year period from 1990 to 2005 was about 131 per year despite the large and growing share of medicaid spending on drugs those numbers represent only portion of true medicaid drug spending states do not include the cost of outpatient prescription drugs provided through capitated arrangements in their reports in 1990 this probably did not present major gap in the available information about medicaid drug spending since only about 10 of medicaid enrollees received coverage through capitated managed care arrangements today however well over onehalf of medicaids enrollees receive some or all of their benefits through medicaid managed care organizations or prepaid health plans in addition other prescription drug payments for products purchased directly from physicians or included in claims for other services such as institutional and home health care are not reported as outpatient drug spending table 7 total

under managed care which is not shown separately in msis data differs significantly from perperson drug spending under ffs which is shown separately in msis data the estimates provided here could be somewhat distorted since medicaid hmos enroll many more children and adults than aged or disabled individuals the exclusion of managed care drug payments might have greater relative impact on estimates of average spending among children and adults crs26 number and cost of prescriptions filled in 2005 medicaid agencies reported processing more than 595 million prescriptions the average cost of prescription for the same year was about 668441 some studies have found large variations in drug use patterns among states among the many reasons for such variation differences in health care needs and the composition of medicaid enrollment drug policies in effect in the state andor different physician prescribing behaviors42 spending on top five therapeutic categories the national pharmaceutical council npc reported that in 2005 over 65 of medicaid drug spending was for drugs in five categories central nervous system drugs cardiovascular drugs psychotherapeutic agents hormones and antiinfective agents43 while statebystate variation is large spending on psychotherapeutic drugs is by far the largest category for which medicaid drug spending occurs on average spending for this class of drugs comprises about 24 of states total drug spending current issues impact of dra 2005 federal upper limits the dra provision instructing cms to use the amp for the purpose of calculating fuls instead of the awp was intended to eliminate some of the opportunities for drug manufacturers to inflate medicaid reimbursements as well as to simply reduce spending for medicaids generic prescription drugs indeed the cbo estimated federal budgetary savings for this provision to be substantial totaling 36 billion for 2006 through 2010 and almost 12 billion over 10 years the amps as submitted by the manufacturers to cms are generally lower than any of the published awps and as yet remain confidential until the passage of dra cms was prohibited from making those prices publically available and could only share them with the us general accounting office and the congressional budget office upon full implementation of the dra provisions amps are to become publically available retail pharmacies have responded to dras ful formula change with concerns that the lower fuls will push medicaid reimbursements for multiple source drugs to amounts below pharmacies acquisition costs small community pharmacies that buy smaller quantities of drugs than the big chain pharmacies are particularly concerned since they have less price negotiating power and almost always purchase through thirdparty wholesalers 41 pharmaceutical benefits under state medical assistance programs 20052006 42 b stuart ba briesacher f ahern d kidder c zacker g erwin d gilden and c fahlman drug use and

disorders and parkinsons and drugs for pain among others crs27 gao was asked to examine the estimated fuls using amp and compare those amounts to pharmacy acquisition prices in memorandum dated december 22 2006 addressed to representative joe barton the gao compared 250 of the lowest amp with acquisition costs for sample of frequently used and high expenditure medicaid drugs gao found that the estimated fuls were below average retail pharmacy acquisition costs for 59 of the 77 drugs examined44 these findings potentially provide support for the concerns raised by the retail pharmacies and may raise other concerns as well for example if the fuls when finally implemented turn out to be below acquisition costs medicaid beneficiaries could suffer reduced access to such products since pharmacies might be disinclined to do business with medicaid programs proposed regulation in december 2006 cms issued proposed rule to implement the dra provisions pertaining to prescription drugs under medicaid the rule which was issued in final form in july of 2007 72 federal register 39142 defines number of important terms related to drug pricing under medicaid including definitions impacted by dra provisions such as amp multiple source drugs and nominal prices the rule has elevated the concerns of pharmacy groups some of those concerns were expressed in letters from members of the us house of representatives and the senate to the acting cms administrator in february and march of 2007 one of the issues identified in the letters was about cmss45 inclusion of prices that are not available to retailers in calculating amp according to the pharmacy groups by including those prices in amp prices and rebates that community pharmacists do not have access to the fuls would be lowered as would medicaid reimbursements potentially making their medicaid business unsustainable46 this has prompted pending lawsuit brought by the national association of chain drug stores and the national community pharmacists association to halt the implementation of this rule at this time the rule has been prohibited from being implemented while the court case proceeds cost sharing and other flexibility enabled by dra as summarized above the dra gave states several new cost sharing options although the outcome of these new options on beneficiaries copayments is not yet clear survey of state medicaid directors conducted during the summer of 2006 suggests that only handful of states consider it likely or were certain to make changes based on the dra options thirty states however
