spending and revenue legislati on adhere to policies set forth in the annual budget resolution while the 1985 act imposes limits on discretionary spending and payasyou go paygo requirement on direct spending and revenue legislation budg et resolution policies are enfo rced by points of order and reconciliation the discreti onary spending limits and p aygo requirement are enforced by sequestration which involve s automatic largely across theboard spending cuts the fy2002 budget resolution called fo r over 100 billion more discretionary spending than the thenexisting limits would have allowed as well as large tax cuts and significant increases in direct spending that would have caused paygo violation in excess of 100 billion budget resolution polic ies assumed that gislation increasing the discretionary spending limits and pr eventing paygo sequester for fy2002 would be enacted later in the 2001 session in late december 2001 the defense appropriations act for fy2002 was enacted pl 107117 wh ich raised the discretionary spending limits and set balances on the paygo sc orecard for fy20012002 to zero thereby preventing sequesters according to the final sequestration report for

of 7313 billion fo r all fy2002 discretionary spending the house and senate are considerin g supplemental appropriations for fy2002 during the 2002 session but techniques such as emergency designations and offsets are expect to be used to prevent sequester from occurring further the fy2002 effects of any revenue or direct spending legislation enacted through september 30 will be included in the calculations for an paygo sequester for fy2003 but paygo sequester likely will be avoide d through directed scorekeeping as has been done in past years this report will be upda ted as

budg et and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended budget enforcement pr ocedures under the 1974 congressional budget act are for the most part permanent and ongoing whereas budget enforcement procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act apply to legislation enacted through the end of fy2002 in his budgets for fy2002 and fy2003 president bush proposed extending procedures under the 1985 act or pursuing other proce dural alternatives1 the 1974 congressional budget act provide s for the adoption by congress of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution recommends the total level of revenues spending the surplus or deficit and the public debt for each year covering at least 5year period total spe nding is allocated to each of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over discretionary or direct spending the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations by subcommittee if the house and senate wish to compel their committees to develop legislation conforming existing revenue di rect spending or debtlimit law to budget resolution policies they may include rec onciliation directives in the budg et resolution so instructing the appropriate committees reconciliation submissions from committees usually are consolidated into an omnibus bill that is considered under expedited procedures enforcement of budget resolution policies ccurs as individual revenue and spending measures including any required reconciliati on legislation are considered points of order established in different provisions of the 1974 congressional budget act allow members to object to legislation that would violate budget resolution policies unless the points of order are waived or set aside the 1985 balanced budget act as amende d in 1990 and later years establishes adjustable limits on discretionary spending and subjects direct spending and revenue legislation to payasyougo paygo requirement under the paygo re quirement direct spending and revenue legi slation enacted for fiscal year may not in the net incur positive balance on multiyear paygo scorecar d while these procedures apply to legislation enacted through the end of fy2002 the paygo effects of such legislation are reflected on the paygo scorecard and s ubject to sequester through fy2006 the discretionary spending limits nd paygo requirement are enforced by sequestration procedure involving largely acr osstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs2 sequestration is trigge red shortly after the end of congressional session if the director of the office of management and budget omb estimates in sequestration report that one or more of th discretionary spending categ ories will be breached or the paygo requirement will be viol ated

omb director as being necessary to eliminate spending limit breach or paygo violation in recent years congress and the president have enacted legislation including procedural features that have prevented sequester from occurring3 budget policies for fy2002 the initial policies for fy2002 regarding disc retionary spending direct spending and revenues were establishe d by the submission of the president george w bushs budget on april 9 2001 and the adoption by th house and senate of the annual budget resolution hconres 83 on may 10 with regard to discretionary spending both president bush and congress recommended sp ending levels well above the existing limits the in itial approach taken by the president and congress for fy 2002 mirrored actions taken the year before by presiden t clinton and congress when the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 were raised by nearly 100 billion4 for fy2002 president bush proposed revised budget authority limit of 661 billion and revised outlay limit of 692 billi on for discretionary spending the presidents request was 112 billion higher than the existing limit on budget authority 549 billion and 120 billion higher than the existing limit on outlays 572 billion the president reserved 841 billion ove r 10 years covering fy20022011 for contingencies which was expected to include among other things additional discretionary spending stemming from review of defense needs and other factors discretionary spending for fy2002 assume d in the budget resolution amounted to 6613 billion in budget authority and 682776 billion in outlays5 house procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act allow it to consider annua l appropriations bills at variance with the statutory discretiona ry spending limits as long as the budget resolution levels are not violated or any violations are waived by simple majority vote accordingly the house planned to cons ider regular appropriations acts for fy2002 compatible with the budget resolution policy and expected that the statutory limits would be revised later in the session so that sequester would occur the senate was faced with more difficult procedural situation because of the point of order provided in section 312b against senate consideration of any appropriation measure violating the statutory discretionary spending limits further waivers of the point of order could be obtaine d only with threefifths votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21084crs4 6 the presidents request for 184 billion in additional defense funding was intended to meet needs consistent with the early
