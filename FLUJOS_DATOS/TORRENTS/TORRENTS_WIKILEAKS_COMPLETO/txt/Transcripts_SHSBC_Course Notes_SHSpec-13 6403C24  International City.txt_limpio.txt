6403c24 shspec13 international city communication is necessary to stop fights as well as to start them the communications that start fights generally occur over distances that are quite great the distances set up high voltages and the terminals have to shout too loudly so the communication is imperfect great distance in communication enters confusion and misunderstoods they have to shout at each other so they consider that they are mad at each other the leaders have the illusion that they are far enough apart to shoot at each other with impunity one can blow up moscow without destroying washington it is an illusion of security lent by distance but this is longer true none of these national governments can really operate broadly for everyones benefit but they try to go out and influence areas beyond their borders the result is continual brushfire wars eg vietnam where washington and moscow fight by proxy the ultimate result is to bring about dangerous environment in its obsession with defense the government absorbs tax money and spends it on arms so we get economic upset and inflation because of shortage of goods peace doesnt pay literally if money wont buy things it inflates we are told that there are plenty of products in the us but the inflation continues because the us dollar has gone international and there is too little production elsewhere inflation leads to communism and money it leads to slavery because one can keep up with it so everyone therefore has to turn to communism russia however has never succeeded in feeding its own people one reason for this fact is russias defense budget and the large army that they maintain another is the fact that the communistic worker is perpetually on strike because he gets reward for his labor politics has entered into economics where it doesnt belong national degradation results from things like draft laws which put people in choice scene being where they dont want to be and doing things that they dont want to do this leads to apathy the governments are at war not the individual american and russian farmers when in comm get along very well only when depersonalized as soldiers can people act for the organizations of earth and slaughter each other the planet is going to blow up or otherwise become very unpleasant unless some changes are made to bring about peace this has been long think this question of how to promote peace ever since egypt in political spheres perhaps impractical but interesting solution is based on the fact that the two sides of the body would perhaps be at war except for the fact that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa so if washington governed the us from moscow and moscow governed russia from washington the chances of war would be immensely reduced advancing the cause of peace pays nobody as things stand now and war does pay the more trouble there is the more importance the political figure has man deifies what causes trouble marie of rumania had very peaceful prosperous government but she didnt get lots of publicity or admiration in the us the war presidents are the ones who get remembered not the peace presidents the common citizen however doesnt make his personal fortune out of such chaos if man is to make any real forward progress he must have peace the only way that government would lay off income tax for instance would be if it werent being faced with demands for military appropriations length of time since the last war determines the state of calm of country the easiest program for international sanity would be one of reducing strife and dissonance in the environment making less threatening environment with less fixation on an unconfrontable future person with future acts weird man is tied to the idea that he lives only once this gives him certain irresponsibility for the area he lives in cf neville chamberlain i bring you peace in our time man wont buy the idea that he will live again there is too much responsibility in this idea to have an effective world peace program the following problems have to be solved 1 the importance of the politician must be maintained he has to keep his importance or he wont support the program 2 continued activity for manufacturers and industry so that the economy wont collapse without war industries 3 shortening of the comm lines among the capitols of the world so that there is greater understanding 4 reduction of individual nations initiatives for waging war 5 reduction of the danger in the environment 6 offering some startling dramatic objective that is very complicated to bring about you need some attractive constructive and hardtoachieve goals the solution would have to be big enough to make the problem of war seem soluble lrh put this together initially as an exercise on capacities of ots one of the things that we have to remember is that we have base called earth we dont want the base any more enturbulated than it has to be nor do we want the base so aware of itself as base that it will resent being one also there are exercises that one should be able to do to improve ones skill they should not be of hostile nature at least towards this planet i am being very vague purposefully so but i think you understand it takes long time to develop technology we have the assets of our technology so our interest in peaceful earth is not only altruistic but also first dynamic interest in its continuance so that our technology can survive earth also has value as base because for one thing it is in nice quiet backwater of the galaxy and likely to be overlooked by others in the galaxy so lrh dreamed up project on which thetans could work together its name became the international city project lrh reached the conclusion that if all the nations capitols were in one geographical area all the major problems mentioned earlier would be solved the governments would be far less prone to go to war they would be close enough to each other to communicate easily there would be false security from distance there would be pleasant social atmosphere with constant parties with heads of states not just diplomats the bombing of such city would become rather remote possibility particularly if you never let people who seemed to be angry at each other leave the capitol at the same time this would create problem of long comm line to the home country you would have to prevent the development of new capitol in the home territory by having the comm line go directly to separate states or counties the comm lines from the governments would not go on via to one major city or central point inside their countries but would go to all the states prefects counties or whatever this would also prevent revolution in the home country it would require building lots of comm lines also building the new capitols in new place would take an immense amount of building additionally you would have an international parliament of earth housed in completely bombproof bunker under mountain it would have appropriate representation based on population production etc there would be plenty of politicking to keep the politicians happy the oneworldtogetherness idea is popular one on earth if elementary steps are taken the rest might follow easily one preliminary step would be 1 all governments turn over nuclear weapons and supplies to the immediately 2 have the and all governments select site for and construct an international city preferably in north africa on the mediterranean coast where land reclamation can expand its area and its comm lines can be easily centered 3 persuade all governments to move their capitols to international city complete with heads of governments confesses and parliaments prohibit secondary capitol or even comm relay center within the country itself 4 secure comm lines and command lines from international city to each internal county or state regard each of these counties or states as an autonomous unit under control of the government in international city 5 reorganize the on formula recognizing land area population figures and production value remove all favored nations categories and the exercise of special privileged and the veto by few form the into judiciary division two houses and an executive branch key officials are to be popularly elected within the nations that they represent and by voting by both upper and lower houses for the head of the reform the charter into an instrument specifically engaged in governing the heads of nations and international affairs forbid in the charter all interference with individuals or smaller communities 6 forbid all warlike treaties of mutual assistance 7 create small effective military force for the abolishing all other war facilities 8 persuade international monetary activities to stabilize economics 9 limit what national government should be up to in the we go ahead with this plan on the basis that general agreement among scientologists would push all the individual efforts into coordinated activity so that they would count here is big plan that is sufficiently sloppy so that if it went pretty far awry if everybody were moving in that direction you would have some possibility of attaining the final objective it has good figurefigure value it is sufficiently interesting plan that it would cause lot of conversation it also has kind of lonely individuality in that one else is doing anything at all for world peace it coheres what could be lots of individual actions it is feasible because it doesnt have to be done perfectly to be done ideas from scientology occur and appear in the world to surprising degree so there is more chance of this plan coming to pass than one might think if scientologists were involved in bringing about what amounts to complete political revolution of earth there would be good dissemination in it scientologists would be available to handle personal upsets etc so their influence would get expanded keep the word scientology parked somewhere on the fringes of this thing and we would get monopoly on mental healing within the boundaries of international city the main virtue of this plan is that there has been complete void of ideas for world peace and this is an intriguing one it is something which if adopted would certainly make the planet less dangerous it has its liabilities but they are outweighed by its advantages someone could perhaps try to take over the central government and become dictator but this would be pretty hard to do hitler failed to take over the world true the international city arrangement does put all the political control in one place but it also puts into that place lot of wily guys not being able to attain their political objectives by war they will try to attain them by diplomacy and they would welcome the proximity of other capitols and large legislature to lobby in they are not about to give this up for dictatorship they wouldnt cooperate with such dictator what about national revolts well that possibility would be equally apparent to the head of every state in international city and i think he would tend to govern in such way that it wouldnt happen the political government of international city itself would be independent of the it would have enough force to balance any house guards or bodyguards that might be around the product of this city government is the safety and security of individuals in international city it would be kept as itself by being made very profitable not political international city would originally be financed in such way that it itself becomes property which becomes very profitable to some people it doesnt matter who they would consider it governmental responsibility because it is profitable the russians would hate this last bit but then they are always goofing up in that area anyway the way to have calm international city is to make sure that the ownership of the land and property of international city brings in money to small group who sit as council in international city and make sure that things remain nice and peaceful and profitable politics would be involved this makes international city hell of piece of bait for some construction company after it has built its buildings it is going to draw rent on them from here on out member of that construction company is going to sit on the governing board of that city with government over its head and all it has to do is sit there and keep the peace in international city youve put very hard core of very hardheaded guys who want to make awful sure that they keep dragging down the rent you see from the white house you are also splitting up political control if you want to see lousy capital take look at capitol that is owned by the government governments take very bad care of things they own because theres profit in it for anybody our direct public interest in international city would be limited to acting as clearing house for information concerning it overtly it is something for scientologists to support help out on and talk about just like everybody else covertly it is training ground for the budding ot nice exercise for him it becomes very fruitful it gives him something useful to do perhaps the main thing that this plan offers is some hope for people it gives the scientologist town it puts piece of this planet into his hands to be interested in i chose the location i did because it is where the oldest comm lines on the planet were located there is lot of coast and country in the area between tunis and tripoli many old comm lines have gone through that area it should be fun for scientologists and ots it should create fantastic amount of new wealth in desert it is busy its broad fourth dynamic method of dedangerizing the environment as process just saying that feasible plan does exist puts in some hope and to that degree it dedangerizes the environment there is more future in it it is method of disseminating to the heads of nations in one small area all at once we have had trouble with governments recently they have been disrespectful we shouldnt stand for it the way you can really upset government is to move its capitol the fact that you are talking about moving all the earths capitols depowers the nations of earth with regard to scientology even if they agree that it is good thing to do removing the nations capitols from their positions makes the nations weak terminal is as powerful as it can hold its position you are threatening them with not being able to hold their position it puts scientology in position of being of comparable magnitude the governments of earth rather then just being of comparable magnitude to single government since it would be controlling the positions of all the governments of earth they dont know the tech so they couldnt explain the odd feeling that they would get at the idea of moving they dont know that it is very important to hold position if you want power just espousing such plan would lead to shift of relative power between you and the government they would feel as though they were slipping if we hold to this as central agreement it will eventually come about it depends for its power on interest there is moneyed group behind this but there is huge vacuum provided that would pick up such people and put them into it but then they are not now ie wont then be in back of it behind it theyre in it we are in back of it
