2007 federal spending for older americans april grady analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division william joseph klunk actuary domestic social policy division summary the federal government currently spends more than onethird of its budget on benefits and programs for older americans for people age 65 and over estimated fy2007 spending for social security dicare and medicaid alone is 833 billion spending for retired federal employees nd military personnel and fo r veterans is also significant and smaller programs add to the total as well tax expenditures might also be taken into account to obtain more complete budget picture if current trends and policies continue federal spending for older americans is expected to grow substantially contributing factors include growing share of the us population being of retirement age real increases in social security benefits due to wage growth and rising health care costs whatev er the magnitude this spending growth will confront congress with difficult choices the share of the federal budget devoted to older americans is growing leaving less available for other spending priorities and leading many observers to warn that current policies are unsustainable because they would require markedly higher taxation or bt levels that could adversely affect the economy although social security spending can be altered via changes to the benefit formula options for reducing longterm gr owth in medicare and medicaid may be less straightforward background the federal government provide s income and other assistance to older americans through number of programs among people age 65 or older the most significant support comes from three entitlement programs social security which pays monthly cash benefits to about 34 million dicare which provides health coverage to about 36 million and medicaid which provides health and longterm care coverage to about 5 million1 other assistance for older ameri cans includes pension benefits andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22008crs2 1 continued average monthly in 2005 althoug h social security and medicare also cover people under age 65 primarily those who are disabl ed older americans comprise majority of enrollees in both programs in contrast about 90 of medicaid enrollees are under age 65 2 us department of education nati onal center for education statistics the

is high the congressional budget office cbo has estima ted that fy2000 federal spending on the elderly was 3½ times the amount spent for fa milies with children under 18 historically state and local governments have taken the lead on spe nding for children through education and other programs although public revenues fo r elementary and secondary education are significant representing about 4 of us gross domestic product gdp in the 20012002 school year less than 10 come from federal sources2 measuring how much the federal govern ment spends on older americans depends on how that population is defined in this report the term older american generally refers to people age 65 and older however other ages could be used the minimum age could be as low as 62 when social security retirement benefits are first available 59½ when the early withdrawal penalty longer applies to qualified retirement plans 55 when federal employees may retire if they have sufficient years of service or as high as 67 when future retirees will be eligible for full social security benefits while the age chosen would affect dollar estimates the general relationship between spending for older americans and the federal budget or us economy would not change another measurement issue is that support and benefits for older americans can take many forms cash payments are direct be nefits whereas tax ex penditures not all of which may be captured in available data s ources are indirect even when federal support is measurable and cl early benefits particular age group other people may indirectly gain for example income and medical benefits for the elderly may save their children from these costs although more co mplete picture would c onsider all of these issues this report focuses on direct cash ou tlays for older americans in given year current outlook significant and growin g portion of the federal budget and the us economy is devoted to spendi ng on older americans in fy1971 46 billion was

the remainder of this re port reflect total spending and enrollment for social security and medicare and do not attempt to parate out beneficiaries under age 65 primarily disabled individuals who account for less than third of current spending on each program 7 based on the consumer price indexall urban consumers from the bureau of labor statistics and data from the social security and medicare trustees benefit growth that exceeds gdp growth rather than price inflation is also an important concept used in medicare and medicaid cost projections which are highly uncertain socia l security cost projections face less uncertainty because benefit levels are formuladriven over the past several decades both medicare and medicaid spending per beneficiary have outpa ced per capita gdp growth by one or more percentage points phenomenon referred to as excess cost growth although it has slowed in recent years any level of excess cost growth means that medicare and medicaid will continue to consume growing share of us economic output in excess of what is expected due to growth in the share of the us population enro lled in these programs under intermediate assumptions that annual growth in medicare sp ending per beneficiary will outpace per capita gdp by one percentage point cbo projects that the share of gdp devoted to medicare will rise from 30 in 2006 to 86 in 2050 see cbo the longterm budget outlook dec 2005 8 cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2008 to 2017 jan 2007drivers of spending growth increases in federal spending for older americans are being driven by two factors growth in program enrollment and growth in spending per beneficiary6 the number of social security medicare and medicaid beneficiaries will increase as the us population ages at the same time spending per beneficiary will increase because of price inflation and real growth in benefit costs that is growth that exceeds price inflation while general price in flation grew at an average annual rate of 30 between 1985 and 2005 social security spending per beneficiary grew 08 percentage points faster at rate of 38 and medicare sp ending per beneficiary grew 35 percentage points fast er at rate of 657 social security benefits are adjusted nnually to reflect price inflation allowing current beneficiaries to maintain purchasing power from year to year social security benefits also grow in real terms as benefici aries are added to the program because initial benefit levels for newl eligible individuals are adjusted for wage growth in the economy which generally exceeds price inflation once persons initial benefit level is determined the annual adjustment for price inflation applies as with health care costs in the private sector real growth in medicare and medicaid benefit costs are driven by increases in utilization and the complexity or intensity of services provided in turn both utilization and intensity are driven by advances in medical technology changes in medical practice and changes in the beneficiary population for example dicare beneficiaries whose average age is increasing may visit doctors more frequently in rn doctors may order greater number of diagnostic tests or offer treatments such as drugcoated cardiac stents that were not available 10 years ago legislative changes such as the establishment of medicare part d drug benefit also affect benefit costs cbo estimates that over the next 10 years only about onethird of the projected increase in social security spending and bout 30 of the projected increase in medicare and medicaid spending can be attributed to increasing enrollment8 the remainder can be attributed to increases in spending per beneficiary under in termediate assumptions for 75year projections by the social secur ity and medicare trustees less than onethirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22008crs6 9 authors calculations based on 2006 projections 10 see discussion in crs report rl32747 social security and medicare the economic implications of current policy by marc labonteof total spending growth in these two programs can be attributed to increasing enrollment9 implications the share of the federal budget devoted to older americans is growing leaving less available for other spending priorities and leading many observers to warn that current policies are unsustainable because they would require markedly higher taxation or debt levels that could adversely affect the economy although the share of the us economy devoted to federal spending for older amer icans is also growing the extent to which this is problem depends on ones view of how the countrys economic resources should be allocated it is likely that some combination of benefit reductions for example through changes in eligibility payment levels covered health care services etc and tax increases which could have direct impact on individual americans will be necessary to bring federal spending to sustainable level as polic options are proposed congress may consider the potential effects on indivi duals from number of perspectives for example if future social security benefits are reduced relative to current law but many people still enjoy higher total income in retirement than todays beneficiaries due to rising wages and overall economic growth are they worse off one way to think about this question might be in terms of poverty rates another might be in terms of how the income of older americans compares to that of working age people since disparities would affect the standard of living that di fferent generations are able to afford yet another way might be in terms of whether current and soonto be retirees are spared from policy changes with any necessary tax increases or benefit cuts falling to their children instead viewed from any perspective growth in federal spending for older americans presents issues that call for congressional ac tion which is likely to be programspecific in nature social security spending can be altered via changes to the benefit formula but options for reducing longterm growth in medicare and medicaid may be less straightforward as discussed earlier spendi ng for these two programs is driven by variety of factors many of which are diffi cult for policymakers to control although single path to slower health care cost growth presents itself few of the potential options include curtailing enrollment making beneficiaries pay more for their care limiting coverage of new items and services and ch anging provider payments because many of these options could simply shift costs to other public and privat payers congress may consider whether the goal of any particular reform is to reduce federal health care spending to reduce economywide health care spending or both10
