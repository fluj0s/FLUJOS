6308c29 shspec301 the service facsimile although we call it service facsimile there is more to be known about it than was in earlier definitions in the past it has been said that service facsimile is what person uses to explain his condition or get his way in the world it is called service facsimile because it was of service to the pc the service fac manifestation is blood brother to the ow mechanism it is how you make people guilty the current definition of service fac is that it is that condition which the individual uses to make himself right and others wrong using this definition we can crack cases the only hazard is the use of rightwrong in gpms but the use of time limitation to in this lifetime obviates any danger of restimulating the gpm the gpm is not the reason for the service fac there is an upperscale rationale survival for instance the darwinian implant see pp 444445 above has to persist at the beginning of it all by itself but this is rare however when the goal to survive occurs it is couched in the word persist there is gpm known to date that contains the word survive this concept is therefore not motivated by bank therefore you can use survive in processing pretty easily implanters used the words live and alive lot but survive is the top scale of all this it is ok for us to go back to healing now since doctors the ama havent appreciated the fact that we ever stopped healing people b they will be socialized in five years anyway they are convinced that curing is impossible however 22 12 of people eg patients pcs or whatever get well with any or or fraudulent treatment they are apparently in an hypnotic state and respond to suggestion so any healing profession should get at least 22 12 cure rate unless it is doing something to depress the patient and to prevent healing from occurring if you get less than 22 12 you are actually impeding the cure only two things prevent the scientologist from healing pcs 1 inability to get in communication with the pc eg because he is dead 2 the service facsimile if we allow for the fact that it takes relatively short time to train an auditor into using thislifetime techniques if you take such an auditor and dont worry about making him into an auditor who can make an ot if you turn him loose with only an understanding of the service facsimile the itsa line and repetitive prepchecking limited to this lifetime if you let him rely on the tone arm there he would be practically sweeping the boards as far as illness is concerned for person to have bad back he must have more than facsimile of an experience involving bad back causing it he must have had it restimulated by something and to have real bad back something must be keeping it in restimulation something has to kick the facsimile in and hold it in you must add to the restimulation factor mental aberration factor it is not just what is restimulated it is what the pc feels might become restimulated what he himself opposes what he becomes afraid of when he is restimulated so the individual is added to the equation the experiential pattern of an individual regardless of incidents containing pain etc might be aberrative for instance say person has lived all his life in very cold environment he gets knowingness in the process if you throw him out in the 40below cold either he has confidence that he can withstand the cold or he doesnt accordingly he either freezes to death or lives respectively this is true even though person is conditioned and trained to handle the cold people may react differently to the same engram there is guarantee that someone will respond one way or the other to their stimulusresponse conditioning one person will be terrified by some danger another person will ignore it another will look and say oh what makes the difference we come back to the service fac for the answer how could you use facsimile to make people wrong so there are three reactions to an engram 1 the guy who is terrified of the facsimile has in back of this lots of ways to be right and to make others wrong by having this facsimile 2 the guy who ignores it has use for it at all one way or the other 3 the guy who confronts it has another method of making others wrong being competent with regard to this type of facsimile the rightnesswrongness possibility is present to some degree in everyone and in every bank to the healer this represents barrier because someone who is using an illness or disability to make someone else wrong wont respond to treatment or if you cure one thing he will pick up something else to do the job of making himself right and others wrong symptomsubstitution see also haley on oneupsmanship games aberrated behavior is service facsimile in at least goodly percentage of cases when you do mimicry processing and the pc persists in crazy behavior he has vested interest in acting crazy this makes it hard to tell how good deaberrative technique is however if it works on lot more than 22 12 of cases it is probably good technique that is rendered ineffective in some cases by service fac the tone arm turned out to be reliable measure of case progress if you dont get destimulation or discharge you will get restimulation because something is happening if you dont get any ta action you know that you are not getting any destimulation or discharge and that therefore restimulation is all that is occurring therefore dont audit without ta action the margin of time during which you can audit pc without ta action before he starts feeling horrible is only about three sessions if pc is upset about auditing is having trouble handling life etc it is only because of overrestimulation from whatever source gpms arc breaks or whatever what about medium or acceptable amount of ta action fifteen to twenty downward divisions per 2 12 hour session excellent ta would be about thirty divisions per session acceptable is 1520 below that level more restimulation than discharge is occurring these are just approximate figures great deal of addingup has not yet been done to tabulate the figures exactly so there is point where there is an apparency of ta motion yet the pc is not getting better and only restimulation is occurring auditing pc on and on with ta will overrestimulate him all the way up the ta dial backwards through 7 all the way to dead thetan lrh introduces here the idea of ta counter why does ta go up and stick only because of the pressure of overrestimulation if you have ta action or if you are getting rising ta without discharge you get overrestimulation because you are overwhelming the pcs power of choice you are trying to get discharge and the pc wont let go of it and he becomes more and more arc breaky if the ta is going up even when you are not auditing backtrack you must still be overwhelming the pcs power of choice between not getting ta and getting high ta we move into service facs when you are doing prepcheck and it turns on mass you have bumped into something that shouldnt be there service facsimile has moved in to assert whatever you are prepchecking and trying to get rid of any mass for thetan is an assertion that something is wrong and there is something weird about it the mass comes from the complete disagreement that you and the pc have concerning whatever it is that turned mass on you want to get rid of it but the pc does not intend to get better because he has to hang onto bank to make someone wrong with it it stands to reason that any thetan that has been hit hard and continuously that has had continued loses and that is trying to get back at and attack some area will be unable to put the itsa line in on that area he cant say if the area is bad or good he cant say what it is he doesnt feel that he can be at cause over that comm line so his final method of staying at cause is to be right and for the other person to be wrong this goes down to the point where he merely has to hold the concept of being right and the other person being wrong this way in sense he is still being cause this mechanism persists therefore because the pc cant asis it because he cant observe it anymore one can be haunted by nonexistent thing if one doesnt have the comm lines to observe it the pc never knows when it goes away if you cant inspect something you cant inspect its cessation therefore for survival the best thing to do is to assume that the thing is still there that is the safest course life teaches you that it is dangerous to go look and see you operate on the principle that if you cant ascertain that something has ended you had better assume that it is continuing something that the pc cant cure with processing must be service fac you can ask the pc how he is making others wrong then when you get it you can ask him how he is being right with it aberrated survival mechanisms all sit around on buttons of rightnesswrongness survival and domination the ow system is connected with this through the makeguilty mechanism these are survival mechanisms buy they are not sensible unfortunately the words rightness wrongness survive and dominate are also in the bank so you have to indulge in some brokenfield running to handle these buttons the more force there is and the less one can stand it and be cause over the user of the force the more one goes into forms of aberrated rightness and wrongness against the holder of force hence people break minor laws to be right about the government since it is so overwhelming this is quite irrational to find service fac you could use the original listing steps of r2 or the preliminary assessment of r3r or you could ask the pc what have you been trying to resolve about your case in processing taking anything that didnt resolve with processing as service facsimile what would be method of making others wrong could also get it be prepared for the service fac not to be very sensible but dont reject it even if it does seem reasonable as long as it is something that hasnt yielded to auditing
