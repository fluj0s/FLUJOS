initiative it ensures that the provisions of the treaties are carried out properly the 27 commissioners including president are appointed by agreement among the governments of the member states for fiveyear terms each commissioner holds distinct portfolio eg agriculture the president of the commission sets its policy priorities organi zes its work and represents the commission internationally the council of the european union council of ministers is comprised of ministers from the national governments as the main decisionmaking body it enacts legislation based on proposals put forward by the commission different ministers participate depending on the subject under consideration eg economics ministers could convene to discuss unemployment policy the presidency of the council currently rotates among the member states for period of six months the european council brings together the heads of state or government of the member states and the president of the commission at least twice year it acts principally as guide and driving force for eu policy the european parliament consists of 785 members since 1979 they have been directly elected in each member state for fiveyear terms the parliament cannot enact laws like national parliaments but it shares codecision power in some areas with the council of ministers and can amend or reject the eus budget the court of justice interprets eu law and its rulings are binding court of auditors monitors the unions financial management additionally number of advisory bodies represent economic social and regional interestsfor membership and began acce ssion negotiations in octobe r 2005 but these will take at least decade to complete the western balkan states also harbor eu aspirations in the longer term the eu opened accession talks with croatia in oct ober 2005 and has named macedonia as candidate for membership the eu represents unique form of cooperation among sovereign states that has been built through series of binding treaties eu members work together through common institutions that embody the eus dual supranational and intergovernmental character different policy areas have different decisionmaking procedures economic trade and social policies for example are currently decided by complicated system of majority voting while decisions relating to foreign and security policy require consensus critics have long charged that the eus decisionmaking processes are too slow and cumbersome and that the eus institutions are overly complex lack transparency and are unintelligible to the average european citizen key institutional reforms in the eus december 2000 treaty of nice were intended to enable an enlarged union to function effectively skeptics argued however that nice set up an even more complex and less efficient decisionmaking process thus eu leaders in december 2001 announced they would convene convention on the future of europe to ex amine how to reform eu decisionmaking further and to review eu structures the european constitution nd the 2005 ratification crisis developing the european constitution the convention on the future of europe began work in march 2002 in brusse ls belgium eu member states appointed former french president valéry giscard des taing to serve as chairman and charged the 105member convention with examining th eus institutions encouraging the development of the eu as coherent foreig n policy actor and strengthening the unions democratic legitimacy in october 2002 the convention decided to develop draft constitutional treaty commonly referred to as

definitive text of the new constitutional treaty key sticking point for some member states were the proposed voting rule chan ges poland in particular feared that the simplified voting rules would give larger member states an advantage the eus current weighted voting system tends to favor smalle r and mediumsized states polish concerns however were overcome and eu leaders sign ed the constitutional treaty in october 2004 they set november 2006 as the target date for the constitutions entrance into force the 2005 ratification crisis in order to come into effect the eus constitutional treaty had to be ratified by all 27 member states through either parliamentary approval or public re ferendums the constitutions future was thrown into doubt following its rejection by french and dutc h voters in separate referendums in may and june 20051 in both countries some arguments ag ainst the constitution reflected concerns that it would enshrine liberal economic tre nds that could undermine french or dutch social protections in addition many french and dutch voters viewed vote as way to express dissatisfac tion with their unpopular national governments the eu bureaucracy and turkeys prospective eu memb ership other reasons for rejecting the constitution differed in france some feared that the constitution by paving the way for further eu enlargement would erode french influence in the eu while dutch voters complained that the eus big countries were already too strong and that certain provisions of the constitution would increase their power even more although several eu member s had already approved the constitution by the spring of 2005 the uk and others decided to shelve their ratification plans in the wake of the french and dutch votes at their j une 2005 summit eu leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the constitution but acknowledg ed that the november 2006 ratification deadline was longer tenable thus the constitution was effectively put

priorities german chancellor angela merkel appeared keen to get new deal on the eu constitution in order to move the union beyond its internal crisis and forge more cohesive outwardlooking eu analysts say that merkels task was eas ed by the april 2007 election of new french president nicolas sarkozy who shared merkels goal of reviving the constitution in some form in order to restore frances role as leader in europe following the vote although germany and many states that had already ratified the constitution were eager to preserve as much of the original document as possible it became evident

all remaining eu states 19 have completed ratification so far and essentially gave the irish prime ministe r until october 2008 to propose way forward some suggest that ireland may seek furthe r modifications to the lisbon treaty and then hold another public referendum as happened with the previous nice treat which was also rejected by irish voters in an initial vote in 2001 others point out that any major alterations would likely be opposed by other member states that have already ratified the treaty at the same time the irish vote has also led to renewed objections to the treaty in the czech republic and poland whic h may further complicate eu effo rts to save the lisbon treaty3 major changes to the eus governing institutions decisionmaking processes and policies agreed to by eu

number would drop from 27 to 15 small states had initially opposed slimming down the commission fearing that it would d ecrease their influe nce however the european council may alter the number of commissioners thus leaving the door open to larger commission in the future increased parliamentary powers the lisbon treaty will extend the european parliaments right of codecision with the council of ministers to many additional policy areas including agriculture and home affairs issues at the same time it will give national parliaments degree of greater authority to cha llenge draft eu legislation new solidarity clause this provision affirms that the eu shall act jointly in spirit of solidarity if an member is the victim of terrorist attack energy supply problem or othe r natural or man made disaster it calls on member states to offer assistance including military resources steps toward building common defense policy as proposed in the constitution the lisbon treaty will assert that the union shall seek the progressive framing of common ion defense policy which will lead to common defense it will establish mutual assistance clause permitting member state that is the victim of armed aggression to ask for military assistance from the other members member states may also engage in structured cooperation which would allow smaller group of members to coope rate more closely on military issues many experts assess that over 90 of the substance of the original constitution has been preserved in the lisbon treaty as with the text of the constitu tion almost all of the

secured changes from the original constitution that seek to address voter concerns about safeguarding social protections and worries about eu enlargement critics contend that the lisbon treaty will do little to simplify the eu and note that some changes will not take effect until 2014 at the ear liest in addition they assert that many difficult issues that are often the source of gridlock such as foreign policy and taxation will remain subject to national vetoes4 implications for the united states many experts assert that passage of the lisbon treaty would have pos itive implications for the useu relationship because certain provisions such as the new president and chief diplomat positions are signed to promote an eu able to speak with one voice on foreign policy issues such an eu would be more credible partner for the united states in tackling common challenges such as terrorism and middle east instability supporters of this view also note that efforts to encourage common eu defense policy and the proposal for structu red cooperation seek to improve european defense capabilities more militarilycapab europe they argue could shoulder greater degree of the security burden with the united states and analysts note that the lisbon treaty should remove at least the technical obstacles to further eu enlargement to turkey and the balkans which the united states strongly supports the nice treaty effectively authorizes the eu to enlarge to 27 members but more conversely some contend that failure to ratify the lisbon tr eaty could stymie further eu enlargement and inhibit eu efforts to be more effective u s partner because eu attention would likely remain focused on internal reforms rather than on external challenges other us experts who worry that larg er and potentially more united eu may seek to rival the united states are more sangui ne about the lisbon treatys potential demise they contend that more unified eu w ould likely lessen wash ingtons leverage on individual members and could complicate us efforts to rally support for its initiatives in institutions such as the united nations or nato these skeptics remain concerned that parts of the lisbon treaty that promote greater eu defense c oordination could lead to the eventual development of eu military structur that would duplicat those of nato and weaken the transatlantic link useu trade relations are unlikely to be significantly affected by the new treaty which does not alter the roles of the eur opean commission or council of ministers in formulating or approving the eus common ex ternal trade policy although eu rules allow the council to approve or reject trade agreements negotiated by the commission with qmv in practice the council tends to employ consensus and will probably continue to do so regardless of the changes in eu voting procedures
