date at least to the civil war when committees sometimes traveled to the front lines to observe conditions and war preparedness for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgov

field hearing brings congress directly to the scene of an important national issue for example in the 110 th congress senate subcommittee held field hearings in new orleans louisiana on the status of repairs in the aftermath of the katrina and rita hurricanes field hearing can serve other purposes it can raise public visibility of an issue provide an opportunity to evaluate government program on site reinforce members relationship with his or her constituents and attract local and sometimes national media attention g5g145g138g150g139g142g155g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 the formal authority for field hearings is found implicitly in chamber rules house rule xi clause 2 states in part that committee is authorized to sit and act at such times and places within the united states whether the house is in session has recessed or has adjourned and to hold such hearings as it considers necessary similarly senate rule xxvi paragraph 1 states that committee is authorized to hold such hearings to sit and act at such times and places during the sessions recesses and adjourned periods of the senate as it sees fit otherwise chamber rules do not distinguish field hearings from those held in washington g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 house and senate committee rules are generally silent on field hearings specifically but in the rules for the 110 th congress some committees included related provisions for example the rules of the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry and the senate select committee on intelligence both require that members be notified 48 hours prior to field hearing for hearings held in washington dc the notice requirement is 24 hours rules of the house committee on education and labor provide another example specifying that field hearings may only be scheduled when authorized by the chairman of the full committee
