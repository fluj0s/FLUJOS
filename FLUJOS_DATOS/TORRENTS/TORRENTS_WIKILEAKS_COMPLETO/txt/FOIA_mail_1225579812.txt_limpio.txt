ucaredu dear ben many thanks for the full response to my query i think my confusion arose from the discussion on realclimate which prompted our earlier communication on this topic which clearly suggested that the observed trend should be expected to lie within the spread of the models rather than neccessarily being close to the mean as the models are stochastic simulations which seemed reasonable ive just reread that post the key paragraph from 1httpwwwrealclimateorgindexphparchives200712tropicaltropospheretrends is as follows the interpretation of this is little unclear what exactly does the sigma refer to but the most likely interpretation and the one borne out by looking at their table iia is that sigma is calculated as the standard deviation of the model trends in that case the formula given defines the uncertainty on the estimate of the mean ie how well we know what the average trend really is but it only takes moment to realise why that is irrelevant imagine there were 1000s of simulations drawn from the same distribution then our estimate of the mean trend would get sharper and sharper as n increased however the chances that any one realisation would be within those error bars would become smaller and smaller instead the key standard deviation is simply sigma itself that defines the likelihood that one realisation ie the real world is conceivably drawn from the distribution defined by the models i had therefore expected the test to use the standard deviations of both the models and the observations which would give flat plot in 5b and there would be an obvious overlap of the uncertainties in 6a at say 500hpa best regards gavin original message from ben santer 2mailtosanter1llnlgov sent fri 10312008 406 am to cawley gavin dr cmp cc jones philip prof env gavin schmidt thorne peter tom wigley subject re possible error in recent ijc paper dear gavin thanks very much for your email and for your interest in our recent paper in the international journal of climatology ijoc there is error in equation 12 in our ijoc paper let try to answer the questions that you posed the first term under the square root in our equation 12 is standard estimate of the variance of sample mean see eg statistical analysis in climate research by francis zwiers and hans von storch cambridge university press 1999 their equation 524 page 86 the second term under the square root sign is very different beast an estimate of the variance of the observed trend as we point out our d1 test is very similar to standard students ttest of differences in means which involves in its denominator the square root of two pooled sample variances in testing the statistical significance of differences between the model average trend and single observed trend douglass et were wrong to use sigma_se as the sole measure of trend uncertainty in their statistical test their test assumes that the model trend is uncertain but that the observed trend is perfectlyknown the observed trend is not mean quantity it is not perfectlyknown douglass et made demonstrably false assumption bottom line sigma_se is standard estimate of the uncertainty in sample mean which is why we use it to characterize uncertainty in the estimate of the model average trend in equation 12 it is not appropriate to use sigma_se as the basis for statistical test between two uncertain quantities the uncertainty in the estimates of both modeled and observed trend needs to be explicitly incorporated in the design of any statistical test seeking to compare modeled and observed trends douglass et incorrectly ignored uncertainties in observed trends i hope this answers your first question and explains why there is inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation 12 and the comments that we made in point 3 immediately before equation 12 as we note in point 3 while sigma_se is an appropriate measure of how well the multimodel mean trend can be estimated from finite sample of model results it is not an appropriate measure for deciding whether this trend is consistent with single observed trend we could perhaps have made point 3 little clearer by inserting imperfectlyknown before observed trend i thought however that the uncertainty in the estimate of the observed trend was already made very clear in our point 1 on page 7 bottom of column 2 to answer your second question d1 gives reasonably flat line in figure 5b because the first term under the square root sign in equation 12 the variance of the model average trend which has dependence on n the number of models used in the test is roughly factor of 20 smaller than the second term under the square root sign the variance of the observed trend which has dependence on n the behaviour of d1 with synthetic data is therefore dominated by the second term under the square root sign which is why the black lines in figure 5b are flat in answer to your third question our figure 6a provides only one of the components from the denominator of our d1 test sigma_se figure 6a does not show the standard errors in the observed trends at discrete pressure levels had we attempted to show the observed standard errors at individual pressure levels we would have produced very messy figure since figure 6a shows results from 7 different observational datasets we could of course have performed our d1 test at each discrete pressure level this would have added another bulky table to an already lengthy paper we judged that it was sufficient to perform our d1 test with the synthetic msu t2 and t2lt temperature trends calculated from the seven radiosonde datasets and the climate model data the results of such tests are reported in the final paragraph of section 7 as we point out the d1 test indicates that the modelaverage signal trend for t2lt is not significantly different at the 5 level from the observed signal trends in three of the more recent radiosonde products rich iuk and raobcore v14 so there is inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation 12 and the results displayed in figure 6 thanks again for your interest in our paper and my apologies for the delay in replying to your email i have been on travel and out of email contact for the past 10 days with best regards ben cawley gavin dr cmp wrote dear prof santer i think there may be minor problem with equation 12 in your paper consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical trophosphere namely that it includes the standard error of the models 1n_m sb_m2 instead of the standard deviation sb_m2 firstly the current formulation of 12 seems at odds with objection 3 raised at the start of the first column of page 8 secondly i cant see how the modified test d_1 gives flat line in figure 5b as the test statistic is explicitly dependent on the size of the model ensemble n_m thirdly the equation seems at odds with the results depicted graphically in figure 6 which would suggest the models are clearly inconsistent at higher levels 400850 hpa using the confidence interval based on the standard error lastly 12 seems at odds with the very lucid treatment at realclimate written by dr schmidt i congratulate all 17 authors for an excellent contribution that i have found most instructive i do hope i havent missed something sorry to have bothered you if this is the case
