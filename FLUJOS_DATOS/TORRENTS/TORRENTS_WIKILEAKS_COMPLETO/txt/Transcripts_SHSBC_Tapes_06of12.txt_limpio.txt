has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc6 renum 6 2 jun 61 flows prehav scale primary scale flows prehav scale primary scale lecture given on 2 june 1961 clearsound checked against the old reel omissions marked substitution marked hi valerie how are you doing today kay good ive said it and thank you i was just looking at car outside thats got hole in its fender and i tried to audit it and it didnt respond so its in apathy laughter thats what you call line charging one present time problem out of existence okay this is what the 2nd of june isnt it and what planet is this this is sixtyone planet all right now i trust you have some good questions today and whats the first one yes male voice regard to energies and flows and the prehav scale uhhuh yeah male voice well sort of general question well sort of could you give us some all right ill give you some gen on that thats very simple question and good one we have this kind of situation in mind where we have phenomenon where an individual has flowed in one direction too long whether that is out or in he has flowed in one direction too long lets take something on which i have fair subjective reality writer who has written too much you know hes just writtenwrittenwrittenwrittenwritten its outoutoutoutoutout all right lets take another example lets take shipping clerk and he shipshipshipshipshipshipships and one fine day he wakes up and he says the writer says if i have to write one more book ive had it i think i will go off and join the french foreign legion and the shipping clerk says well i feel very degraded and im going to quit why because these things have flowed in one direction well its phenomenon an electrical phenomenon really and we get an awful lot of our material from the field of nuclear physics or used to and now were telling nuclear physics that is to say were in position now where we know lot about energy and so forth that the boys crawling in and out of the woodwork at the atomicenergyuniversitygrant areas never heard of and are always quite amazed about the phenomena of standing waves of tendencies of flow sizes of particles or if there are any and such things as this are probably getting better known to us than to other people and you get ridge because actually of the inertia of particle its more complicated than that theres little bit of newtons law of interaction mixed up in all mental activities by people who have gravity effective on them now if youre affected by gravity and you dont float off into the air then to some degree or another youre affected by newtons law of interaction well thats nothing much to you nor here nor there but actually is the basic reason for and the postulates causing this thing are the basic reason for frozen flows for every action there is an equal and contrary reaction all right thetan believes this so when he pushes particle out he also has the reaction you see of the particle coming back you see for instance we push this emeter and the emeter pushes slightly against us well newtons law of interaction is not true fortunately it is only true for objects of comparable size and mass the reductio ad absurdum is you stamp against earth earth stamps against you well ive never had earth stamp against so except when i was up in airplanes and got careless and didnt keep the airplane under or something like that and then it was obvious that i was standing still and earth was moving toward the point is here that for objects of comparable magnitude push against the emeter you can actually feel it in your hand theres slight backpush all right the facsimiles of these backpushes are neglected your attention is on the emeter dont you see be pushing it well your attention the attention of the writer is on pushing out the words and pages and the attention of the shipping clerk is putting out books you see all right so if this is the case then they utterly neglect and rarely asis because theyre not terribly aware of it this little backpush every time you throw book in the mails you see why there was so much effort coming back toward one and its neglected similarly lets say the colored gentleman who has good highpaid job sticking his head through canvas and letting people throw baseballs at him i think thats well honored profession of one time or another in carnivals and so on all right so here he has these baseballs coming in at him all the time the visible picture you see is made of everything but his attention goes on the incoming baseball yeah but as this baseball is coming in actually there is contrary reaction that he pays attention to because hes interested in the baseball hes not interested in that contrary reaction he wishes there were more of it if anything you see to slow that baseball down and the next thing you know he will have too many baseballs thrown at him now hes actually the it isnt the injuries of the baseballs or anything its just the fact that hes built up ridge in front of his face that consists of not the incoming baseball but the resistance going back against the baseball you got the idea well its the resistance back against that baseball that sticks there not the baseballs so he has too many baseballs thrown at him and all of sudden gets horrible feeling of pushing out that way similarly the fellow mailing too many books gets horrible feeling of mysterious undefinable pushing back against himself youve got the idea and he couldnt possibly explain what this pushing back against himself is he feels like he has pressure on himself why i had somebody the other day talking about she felt she had pressure on her face see well its just this its the reverse push so therefore its inexplicable he knows it cant be books you see because books go out and this pressure hes feeling is coming in and the fellow with his head through the canvas he knows it couldnt be baseballs because baseballs come in whereas this pressure makes him feel like hes losing everything in front of him you got the idea well hell feel like hes losing everything in front of him up to point where he cant lose any more in front of him without it becoming painful see hes got an outpush see the reaction of the mind against this incoming object is this outpush this outpush this outpush and the next thing you know he just figures he cant push out one more thing if he did itd kill him hes sure of this and at this moment he has stuck flow if you ask him to push out one more thing he says thats impossible the one thing in the world he knows he cant do is push out that one more item and he goes unconscious and that is dopeoff its flowed too long in any one direction its not simple mechanism where just flow too long in any one direction produces stuck flow ive given you the whole gen of it here it actually produces reverse flow flow too long in any one direction produces reverse flow to it you got the idea so frankly at that stage of the game its toss up whether hes going to pass out because you throw baseball at him or hes going to pass out because he resists something or tries to push something away from him get this exercise now get the idea of baseball being thrown at you now get the idea of throwing away something thats as far as its going to run without locking up you see because you now youve got to say get the idea of baseball thrown at you now get the idea of throwing away something what are we doing in essence were running really flow that is all in one direction but were running the flow itself and his resistance to it alternately and it goes flipflop flipflop apparently now we say get the idea of baseball being thrown at you thank you get the idea of baseball being thrown at you thank you get the idea of baseball thrown at you thank you now one of two things is going to happen either the field or the energy particles in front of his face are all going to go black see thats symptom of stuck flow or hes all of sudden going to get an avalanche triggered and the next thing you know all the baseballs that have ever been thrown at him hit him thats an avalanche brrrrrrrr they come in you see he could just as easily get an avalanche of resistance but hed be in awful bad shape to get the avalanche of resistance you got the idea actually what we mean by an inversion is the avalanche of resistance you see the fellow has longer any effect from it coming in hes only affected by resisting it now if you want to see some guy in this kind of state and they are around in practically any case you could find this mechanism on them you say to this fellow now get the idea of resisting baseball and he gets the baseball in his face now you say get the idea of baseball hitting you and he feels like hes going to fall over on his face because he feels himself pushing out you got the idea these flows have exactly turned around and thats what we know as an inversion and thats actually why we call it an inversion because its flow gone backwards now postulates follow this kind of thing you see and the fellow will change his mind on the postulate instead of interest he gets peculiar interest well it follows down the mechanics of this other thing now why dont we run ow ow ow ow of course ow is just dandy because thats out its in its out its in its reach withdraw reach withdraw but only from one person and let tell you something about reach and withdraw from one terminal it doesnt account for all of the motions possible now as long as the individual is below change ow is effective and he only runs well on ow from what he caused and what he withheld as long as hes below change thats the makebreak point of ow ow limited theory i call your attention to that bulletin i give you another datum right on the top of that bulletin right now and that is that the limited theory of ow stops at the level of change there is the point below which ow is 100 percent effective and above which it ceases to be effective change is the explanation of it all why well im sorry i dont feel as glib today as i did the other day when i explained it to somebody very glibly but it was sort of interesting its sort of an involved explanation and therell probably be better explanation for it but i explained it perfectly and then i didnt listen to myself and but it was its like this the outflow and the inflow gets locked up in some particular fashion and then below this level the individual is totally individuated he can longer change his viewpoint he can longer experience change and the moment he becomes very afraid of change occurring leaving him on some individuated point of the bracket and as they go crazy they dont go down from ow on lunatic real raving lunatic youd probably have to find the bracket that was live and it would be way below ow see itd be some oh i dont know any one of thirtytwo sides of the bracket you see it would be what others were doing to others that would be the only side of the bracket that would work itd be the others doing it to others or something like that and then that would be terrible they have great reality on others doing it to others and as you shook his mind up about it little bit youd just shift him around on the bracket and hed say well isnt it terrible how i caused world war ii when you know personally he was he had body in pawn on mars at the beginning of it you know hell all of sudden come up with obsessive cause well actually thats high point but it stays in for quite some time as long as the individual is allergic to change he individuates because the change on various flow lines are extremely productive of these ridges lets say the individual is fluid on the subject of change he doesnt mind change he can handle change he can experience change so therefore the baseball coming in and hitting the fellow with his head through the canvas well if he could experience all the changes that were there he wouldnt resist it but if he starts resisting the changes and starts setting up this newtons law of interaction the next thing you know why hes halfway around the bend on the subject of ow he thinks there will be consequence of everything he does he just knows he wont be able to breathe without there being consequence all hes got to do therefore to go through life its perfect solution is that every time you pass sporting goods store you dont look in the window and see baseball lying there on display you see thats good one thats fine now we know that thats safe you know he knows theres going to be consequence to what he does everything he does so he knows better than to walk down blocks that have sporting goods stores in them and then he knows better than to go downtown where there might be that block and then he knows better than to go out in the yard because you see he might see the town and we get the odd phenomenon of somebody being stuck in the house and then we cant figure out why is this man stuck in the house and we start running houses its baseballs now theres the goofball reach of this and its practically unplumbable but you can follow it down with an emeter and find out why the individual is stuck in the house hes trying to avoid being hit in the face with baseballs that are longer being thrown at him and this is very logical all all horses sleep in bed sort of proposition by the way thats becoming such stable datum that somebody told the other day that they were going to start making simmons beds for horses anyway heres here is your change so when an individual can longer tolerate change he becomes afraid of consequences because the consequences of change of course are change and he can longer stand by consequences so therefore hes going to have consequences so the moment that hes worried about consequences why hes into the ow bracket and thats why everybody on this planet can run ow so easily at lower stages but as you go up on sop goals you run out of this and i have not burdened your brains and i have let you waste some auditing time by making you run all brackets from the beginning on everything because the prehav scale is fairly rapid and it will very shortly catch up with all brackets you got the idea the change gets level for level of the prehav scale in other words tolerance comes up and all of sudden instead of it only being effective on himself to others it becomes effective on other brackets now also in view of the fact that the individual can be stuck on these other brackets and then itll bring it back onto himself for case below average or case above average it is safest to run brackets you got the idea and for the average case you waste little time running brackets but you had better not tangle your wits up with at what point he ceases to have the 0w mechanism sort of thing function cease functioning at what instant on what subject does he have this function well i couldnt calculate it myself so im not going to expect you to so the safe thing to do is run brackets you got the idea so fear of consequence which is to say fear of change results then in resistance to change which brings in newtons law of interaction the guy must resist changes or motions so as soon as he has to resist changes or motions he starts setting up these ridges as i described to you at the first part of that this statement you see and when these ridges are set up the only way to take them apart is take them apart on both sides alternately you take apart the push out you take apart the push in therefore it doesnt matter whether the individual is stuck on pushing things out or stuck on pulling things in youre going to take apart both of it anyhow and then it doesnt matter if hes really spinny on some point or another as most any mind is another bracket out here to another you know this interchange out here hes dispersed outside of himself and this is really the one hes running and while hes sitting over here and not running it so its best to have that bracket functioning too dont you see and you save time and you dont bog case now what it requires to run the exact number of commands necessary to get the exact flow out of the road is actually beyond your ability to detect at this stage of the game but running all sides of bracket evenly takes care of all the flows you will encounter without jamming any so its way out of the rat race now if an individual goes unconscious which is to say he cant confront the change if he goes unconscious at some point while youre running good fiveway bracket one of two things is wrong hes either got bracket that is so unbalanced that it wont take both sides of it so well all right so what so he goes unconscious hell recover or more particularly he isnt doing one of your commands and in view of the fact that this is the only one that can get in your road that he isnt doing one of the commands of the brackets somewhere then when pc goes unconscious you should always check if he is having tremendous difficulty with and isnt answering one side of the bracket and if he isnt all right dont hang him with it just check him over you know the way you do that is you ask just once around you ask him the question did you not have you been answering it but did you answer that just once around now did you answer that to your satisfaction and the fellow says well uuuh i as matter of fact i never have been able to answer that leg of the bracket in other words youre youre inadvertently guilty of having given number of auditing commands without getting an answer and you must always one of the basic rules of auditing is you always get an answer to your auditing command one command one answer one answer one command also although that sometimes gets disobeyed when you run into very looped up bracket thatll avalanche you know youre on some hot subject with the pc and it goes brrrrrt and youve got whole bunch of them and the funniest thing i ever saw was pc in staff clearing course one time sitting there he said i cant answer the what have you failed to help you see because it just keeps going through my mind and he looked very roundeyed at the auditor and he said it just keeps going through my mind who who who who who who you just triggered the automatic side of the bracket thats all there is to it now does that answer your question ken male voice yes it does thank you all right we got another question okay gee im glad youre getting smarter yeah jan female voice one came up today which was on just how much on american meter the relaxation of the pcs hands while running process may influence the tone arm position and whether its just okay to allow for this and i checked how much it just was with somebody not being audited and whether you could just allow for that relaxation of the hands as being indicative of some mass shifting so you count it as process effect anyway see what i mean dont worry too much about it female voice just dont worry about it its just like i ask pc now all right now have you got withhold and he wraps both cans around his head and changes the shape of his feet and and kicks the emeter and backs up and coughs couple of times and so forth well i say it read it read i ask him again just to make sure it always does similarly this is just taken into the gross error of the situation trying to eliminate anything like that as an error would be nearly impossible female voice yeah it amounted to practically half tone on an american meter sure female voice just relaxation of the hands that wasnt even visible particularly thats right i wouldnt worry about it too much female voice yeah all right because theyre not going to relax and tighten their hands for the bracket female voice yeah you know youve got meter an inherent error in any meter that has to do with the pc being connected to it and its not very gross error you can do some weird things you can have the pc hold to the tips of the electrodes just with his thumb and finger and get one of the highest tone arms you ever cared to see nice heavy high tone arm with heavy needle yeah you can just have him hold just hold the tips of the can just barely touching both cans and you get very tough looking pc but you can get workman with calluses and have him hold onto the cans and you dont get tough looking pc because of the calluses the size of the persons hand might have something to do with it lot of factors could enter into it but actually its not gross its not enough to bother with the emeter tells you most everything you want to know and in view of the fact that youre adjudicating basically on reaction of the meter over given period of time we can assume that the pc over any given period of time if the process is flat is more or less static so you see it wouldnt tell you the process was flat or not flat when it wasnt flat or something of this sort its not even anything that you should watch for but you should do this with an emeter just like it says in emeter essentials that it isnt kidding thats whole drill you should actually get somebody to sit down and go through all the body motions that there possibly could be and handle the cans in all sorts of weird ways and lift their fingers and put them back again and cough and sneeze and just watch what happens to the needle and tone arm of the meter and then that is the best way of sorting out bodymotion reactions on meter and you can actually get so good at them that you dont the only one i have to look at is when im getting rock slam or i start to get ill get momentary rock slam of some kind or another i will normally look over at the pcs hands to find out if he lifted his finger because that can be approximated you can lift your finger and get rock slam but it isnt constant enough and you will all of sudden see that it is the hands or it is the rock slam you can differentiate there too but always make sure that it isnt somebody going playing morse code on the on the electrodes now theres one more point about this you can take both cans in one hand as you do in these point out things and you will find out that the left side of the body and the right side of the body and the right side of the body versus the left side of the body are all different and this is apparently of great astonishment to many auditors and it upsets them end well i dont know so the you remember the old epicenters it just means the the guys epicenters are out thats all if you wanted to know if pcs epicenters were in good shape or not in good shape have him hold both cans in his right hand then have him hold both cans in his left hand put kleenex between them and both cans in his left hand both cans in his right hand see if the read is the same if the read isnt the same his epicenters are out what are you going to do with this today nothing its one of those little things we cannot live without knowing you know its like reading the almanac but ive seen ive seen auditors get quite concerned with the fact this happens it also will read differently if you shove them under the pcs armpits itll also read differently if you hold him down take his shoes and socks off and adhesivetape the cans to the soles of his feet itll read differently but only in terms of how much resistance its measuring now i can imagine it one day if this emeter ever gets into the hands of the government that is about the 50 percent of the populace will probably be getting their emeter checks that way the cops will jump on him and the fellow says i wont pick up the cans and the cops will jump on him and hold him down and adhesivetape the cans to the soles of his feet and find out if he murdered his grandmother and because the guy is resenting it anybody who would do that probably couldnt read meter anyhow and if he was member of one of these existing governments why hed then of course say well it had reaction ahha murdered his grandmother thats good enough for us hang him actually they that wasnt what they were after him for it was because he hadnt he hadnt not paid taxes yeah itd be pretty confused picture was there another question female voice well it was just that today we found out how to produce perfectly steady continuous rock slam on meter with body reaction good female voice with the cans how do you do it female voice just take the cans in both hands and keep rotating them like this and you get beautiful steady rock slam that just goes on and on good enough all right all right take the cans in both hands and twiddle them and rotate them round female voice just goes round and round and round and round and round and round and you get rock slam thats worth knowing its good way to demonstrate rock slam its worth knowing how to demonstrate any of these phenomena very interesting okay is there anything else female voice ron yes female voice i would like to have something on tape with regard to why the various levels are on the prehav scale because some people come up to and they say why is this create here you see and i have to tell them well this is obsessive create you see and id like to have tisnt you know its reactive create female voice well reactive create yeah all right thats good female voice all right ill answer that female voice yeah why are the levels on the prehav scale on the prehav scale thats pretty broad question im not laughing at suzie but i just suddenly realized that somebody asking that question that would be an interesting question to bring up holy cats female voice i just wanted the levels gone through so i can take yeah well thats thats approximately it that is the same question female voice right boy how much time we got here well ill tell you ive been studying the mind for number of years and there are various phenomena have been noted and these phenomena are not necessarily in agreement with sane and normal society the way it thinks it operates and thats why were winning because with this sane and normal society that everybody thinks is operating nobodys winning so you see there would be basically and foremost we would have had to have recovered some of the broad differences between how people think it ought to be and how it is now if weve recovered this broad difference between how we think it ought to be and how it is then of course we can asis some of the difficulties and upsets of human being but if we stay with how it ought to be or how were educated to believe it should be ah were hung with these alterises now weve got in the prehav scale pretty close actually the way it is and we havent got in the scale the way it ought to be at all so it comes in with dull crash to find god at the bottom of the prehav scale what cause and then faith oh ill give you an idea ill give you perfect substantiation i dont hang around on on the backs of auditors chairs ready to stick out my chest like pouter pigeon and pat myself on the back saying i was right i merely make disgusting habit out of being right and i sort of take it as matter of course when it works out that way although its usually very interesting to that it did work out it seems curious sometimes but its like this pc the other day in an hgc was audited on faith and he blew straight out of his head of course where would you think level was that the first moment that an individual touched it he would sort of kind of disappear out of the body and away and gone and here and there and everyplace else wouldnt you say that was pretty low level and yet that has been the most highly advertised commodity for the last two thousand years that anybody has been trying to sell you talk about selling blue sky everybody has been rushing up and down the streets with nickel on the drum selling faith faith faith faith youve got to have faith youve got to have faith weve got something here in which you dont have to have any faith to have it work and that is of course the most astonishing thing in scientology so here comes faith i put it on the bottom of the prehav scale because it belongs there because its nonobservational level it is the most nonobservational level there is there is other level that is as least as less observational than faith everybodys got faith see well by definition faith is accepting something without inspection or observation and checkup of any kind now that isnt anything wrong with faith there isnt any there isnt anything wrong with doing this if you didnt have some confidence in your fellow man and walked around little bit blindfolded youd never get these surprise engrams but i dont mean to be sarcastic the thing actually is there it isnt that ron put it there its where it is so there it is all right now lets take up this next thing as long as its amongst us girls here lets take up this thing called if youll excuse god all right lets take oneakhenaton egyptian pharaoh ruled 13721354 bc proposition see theres only one and there he is and he caused everything get that now he caused everything do you realize what shape that god would be in right at this moment if he did nothing but make and create things and you could never reach him and never say anything to him now what do you think would happen id say that anything if it was just one thetan that was called upon to make all these solids and spaces what kind of duress must this fellow be under to have to propitiate the lot of us that much i think if theres anybody spun in it must be this god you look at all the signs and analyze it anyway you can in running pcs or looking at life and youll find out at once that this cause you know just cause you know like that im going to hit you with the thunderbolts and you cant hit brother what that would do to thetan so i figure god plowed in long time ago now thats an awful comment for to have to make but thats that happens to be actually happens to be my full belief on the thing ive looked it all over from every side and i cant get away from this opinion that if there was one god man hes had it and i even thought one time of gee you know we could whip together handy jimdandy little religion here in the society for the resurrection of god see on the basis that the poor fellow plowed himself in helping us all out and that we should give him hand now i know this all sounds very loopy and very ridiculous but that is why that level is there it works there now anybody who is on an obsessive cause is practically nuts now we are talking about of course the reactive reactions this emeter tests reactive reactions and thats all it tests so if we had nothing but analytical reactions on scale then the scale would be of use to us whatsoever so were looking for the deepseated things the prehav scale is actually the reactive scale the reactive bank scale when an individual is at length able to have he doesnt have to have bank so of course the bank disappears at the point have so there wouldnt be anything to measure of any kind whatsoever if we measured it on the analytical scale but there isnt anybody in this corner of the universe that i know about right now that knows what that analytical scale really is except our axioms 1 and 2 thats the best description of it so the analytical have scale above have the analytical scale would simply be axioms 1 and 2 those are the only basic truths there are those are fundamental truths if anything is true then theyre true all other truths are the result of postulates considerations and agreements so as result it would just depend on what bunch of thetans got together and agreed would be on that scale thats thats the whole thing and theyd say well this is the scale and were going to have saucepans at this level and were going to have chimney pots at that level and were going to have singing dixie at this level and thats our scale and in view of the fact that they were analytical and could change their minds and werent very serious about it anyhow of course that would be the scale were talking about the fixed drivenintoconcrete nowimsupposedto thisisit cantbeviolated thisiswhywerehere scale and thats the prehav scale and this is the order of the value of postulates which are fixed postulates and which are not usually changeable and have never been changeable in the absence of scientology and thats what that scale is all about but as far as thats concerned i think its quite remarkable scale now at some time in the past at the beginning of track sometime this scale must have been dreamed up just about like that now to recover the scale again is quite trick now im not trying to tell anybody that all levels that are on the present prehav primary scale that should be there are there there might be some levels that arent there i could think of dozen to put in offhand but how much time have auditors got to assess the primary scale and theyre all on the secondary scale anyhow now now there are also some repeating levels on that scale for instance at cause you might not get fall at cause and you would get fall on blame and blame was on the original scale you see so you have to watch that primary scale rather alertly but theres harmonics so youll get more drops on the new primary scale with its sixtysix sixtyfive levels youll get more drops going up and down it than you would get on the old scale because there are some action words in it rather than conditions theres another use to this scale that i havent burdened anybodys wits with yet by the way just in passing ill comment on it and that is combination inside the primary scale and man that can get so involved that it is marvelous lets supposing you assess motion this is the most flagrant example lets supposing you assess motion and as youre assessing you found out agree fell and falls and motion falls now you go into the secondary for motion and then into the secondary for agree and you find which two falls on that and youll get some of the most remarkable combinations of commands you ever heard of you just try it sometime you wont believe some of them you cant run motion all by itself the pc is just liable to run into brick wall so you can combine it with almost anything that is on the scale but its usually like dislike agree or disagree but remember you could combine it with anything on the like dislike agree disagree secondary scales which gets pretty remarkable and then motion could be assessed all the way out onto its secondary scale and youd get some word for motion and you just look it up when you see these scales and youll howl with laughter because it makes some of the most fantastic combinations but listen its going to make sense to somebody all right well now i hope i didnt mean to slight your question in any way because it should be stated i havent given any lectures done any talking about this prehav scale its just sort of grown and the only lecture i know of about it or the only lectures i know of about it are in the johannesburg congress tapes and its advanced so far now beyond those that theres hardly any recognizing it its levels may not be all exact they might not be the exact level wherein but they dont have to be theres stress on this now if i ever find one of them out ill put it right and tell you about it but it usually is pretty good the top of the scale is the top of the scale and the bottom of the scale is sure the bottom of the scale and individuals will start to get rise as you go up that scale at certain levels just like they did on the original prehav so all is pretty well with it im very happy with it does that answer the question female voice mm anything else about it female voice mmmm you sure female voice mmhm all right okay is there anything else all right thank you thank you very much and have very very good weekend will you audiencethank you end of lecture
