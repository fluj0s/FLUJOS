marijuana for medical purposes the supreme c ourts decision in united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative and related legal issues stripped of its foot notes and citations to authority penalties authorized for violations of the controlled substances act are discussed in crs report 97141 drug smuggling drug dealing and drug abuse background and overview of the sanctions under the federal controlled substances act and related statutes background the federal controlled substances act the act outlaws the cultivation distribution or posse ssion of marijuana the ban is component of federal and state schemes which regulate the sale and possession of drugs and other controlled substances the state of california has created medical necessity exception to its marijuana prohibitions the oakland canna bis buyers cooperative the coop was one of the entities which dispensed marijuana to patients qualified to receive it under state lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20998crs2 federal authorities sued to enjoin cultivation and distribution of marijuana in violation of federal law by th coop and its suppliers the federal district court granted preliminary injunction which the court of appeals overtur ned for failure to consider an implicit medical necessity defense the necessity or choice of evils defe nse has been recognized under various circumstances by number of other lower federal appellate courts the supreme court seemed to verify its vitality at least indirectly when it described the prerequisites for the defense to an escape charge where criminal defendant is charged with escape and claims that he is entitled to an instruction on the theory of duress or necessity he must proffer evidence of bona fide effort to rrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed necessity has st its coercive force supreme courts coop decision the coop argued that necessity as common law defense was an implicit exception to the acts prohibitions member of the supreme court agreed in fact the c ourt questioned the very existence of federal necessity defense although as the concu rring opinion points out the case holds more than that there is necessity defense to the federal proscription on the cultivation or distribution of marijuana on the basic point the members of the c ourt were of one mind congress in the act addressed and rejected the very excep tion for which the coop sought recognition congress outlawed manufacturin g or distributing controlled substances except as authorized in the act the only authorized exception for schedule i controlled substances such as marijuana is governme nt approved research the coop did not argue that it was engaged in government approved research there is other explicit exception for marijuana but the federal necessity defense is creature of common law frequently assumed if rarely cited by name and congress did not reject it by name yet congress did limit schedule i to those controlled substances with currently accepted medical use it assigned marijuana to schedule i thus it is clear from the text of the act that congress has made determination that mar ijuana has medical benefits worthy of an exception the statute expressly contemplates that many drugs have useful and legitimate medical purpose and ar necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the american people 801a but it incl udes exception at all for any medical use of marijuana unwilling to view this omi ssion as an accident and unable in any event to override legislative determination manifest in statute the court rejected the cooperatives argument the clarity of congresss rejection of medical necessary defense doomed the coops invocation of the constitutional voidance doctrine canon of statutory construction available only in cases of ambigu ity the court declined to consider the constitutional issues which might have called for avoidance in the face of an ambiguity because the lower court had not raised them constitutional issues although the court set them aside the coops brief presented commerce clause enactment clause and due process clause questions thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20998crs3 commerce clause in conjunction with the actment or necessary and proper clause empowers congress to enact legislation regulating interstate and foreign commerce congress passed the act at least in part as an exercise of its powers under the common clause congresss commerce clause powers are substantial but not unlimited the court summarized the scope of those powers in lopez and morrison two instances where the commerce clause was found insufficient to support claim of legislative authority first congress may regulate the use of the channels of intersta commerce second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in inters tate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities finally congresss commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce recognizing that the boundaries of this last category of commerce clause power intrastate activity with an interstate impact are not always easily identified morrison and lopez identified some of the signs which reveal that regulated activity may in fact have significant impact on interstate commerce first they observed that 922q the section at issue in lopez was criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise however broadly one might define those terms the second consideration that we found important was that the statute contained express jurisdictional element wh ich might limit its reach to discrete set of firearms possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce th ird we noted that neither 922q nor its legislative history contains express congressiona l findings regarding the eff ects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in school zone finally our decision in lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possessi on and substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated the coop argued that only the cultiv ation and distribution of cannabis in exchange for money or barter can be consid ered commerce but even such commerce here is exclusively intrastate and therefore not within the power of congress to regulate commerce among the states yet the act including its proscriptions on the cultivation distribution and possession of ma rijuana appears to be within the congresss commerce clause powers as described in lopez and morrison they identify as indicative of criminal statutes beyond the clauses reach those which purport to punish activities that have nothing to do with commerce or any so rt of economic enterprise as the coops very name oakland cannabis buyers indicates cultivation distribution or possession of marijuana almost always involves or is closely linked to some form of commercial activity particularly if di stribution requires the particip ation of physicians and health care insurers even marijuana grown at hom for personal medical use might find its way within regulatory scheme under the commerce clause lopez and morrison cite with approval wickard v filburn in which the court upheld the regulation of wheat grown locally for home consumption as rationale co mponent of the regula tion of the interstate wheat market in gonzales v raich the court followed the path laid out in wickard it had difficulty concluding that congress had ra tional basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and posse ssion of marijuana would leave gaping holehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20998crs4 in the csa in light of the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere as well as concerns about diversion into illicit channels in the mind of the court when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in fungible commodity congress was acting well within its authority to make laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the several states that the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of moment even if congress had lacked the legislativ authority to ban cultivation distribution and possession of marijuana under the commerce clause its legislative authority to implement our various treaty obligations for the suppression of illicit controlled substances would probably be sufficient when congress enjoys legislative subject matter jurisdiction such as the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce it may nevertheless elect to pass laws which exceed what is constitutionally proper unde r the implementary necessary and proper or enacting clause for instance legislation is not proper for carrying into execution constitutionally vested powers such as thos under the commerce clauses when it seeks to compel the states to enact or enforce fe deral regulatory program or to when it issues directives requiring the states to address particular problems or commands the states officers or those of their political subdivisions to admin ister or enforce federal regulatory program the coop argued that congress is not actin g in the necessary and proper exercise of its legislative authority when it acts in total derogation of rights which the people of given state have identified as fundamental unenumerated constitutional rights the contention may have helped spur the three c oncurring members of the court to urge at least rule of construction that would recogn ize medical necessity defense for marijuana possession the majoritys sweeping dicta nd the accompanying footnote which sparked justice stevens comments however may reflect the fact that at least five members of the court found the necessary and pr oper argument unpersuasive of course the coops ninth amendm ent fundamentalunenumeratedrights argument is closely akin to its substantiv due process contentions ie that these patients have fundamental right to be free from government interdiction of their personal selffunded medical decision in consu ltation with their physician to alleviate their suffering through the only alternative available to them the due process clause provides heig htened protection against government interference with certain fundame ntal rights and liberty interests in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the bill of rights the liberty specially protected by the due process clause includes the rights to bod ily integrity and to abortion and in all likelihood to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment the court however has been reluctant to expand the concept of s ubstantive due process and has specifically refused to consider physician assisted suicide among the fundamental liberties so protected glucksberg seems to pose major obstacle to recognition of right to use marijuana for medicinal purposes for it appears to have refused to acknowledge the right which the coop claims the coop claims patients ve fundamental right to be free fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20998crs5 government interdiction of their personal selffunded medi cal decision in consultation with their physician to alleviate their suffering glucksberg found that terminally ill patients facing the prospect of painful deat h have due process right to the assistance of their physicians to secure and assist in the administration of painless but fatal substances to alleviate their suffering beyond this the glucksberg expansion tests are not pa rticularly helpful they require that those rights within the ambit of due process protec tion consist of those fundamental rights and libertie s which are objectively deeply rooted in this nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of order liber ty such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrifice d the history of the coops asserted right is arguably exactly the opposite it is hist ory replete with govern ment regulation of the practice of medicine of th distribution and use of medicinal products of controlled substances and of mar ijuana in particular federal regulation of marijuana as crime control measure dates back from the marihuana tax act of 1937 by which time every state in the union already regulated its sale the act was modeled after the more general harri narcotics act of 1914 under which opium and other narco tics were regulated congre ss passed the earlier food and drug act of 1906 to prevent the manufacture sale or transporta tion of adulterated misbranded or poisonous or deleterious foods drugs medicines or drugs and for regulating the traffic therein 34 stat 768 1906 in more general terms the practice of medicine has long history of be ing regulated to protect the public safety glucksberg s dicta seems to further undermin any contention that due process substantially restricts the federal governments authority to refuse to legalize marijuana for medical use there the court cited united states v rutherford for the observation that congress could reasonably determine to protect the terminally ill less than other patients from the vast range of selfstyled panaceas that inventive minds can devise here congress appear s to have done just that it has concluded that marijuana is highly addictive and has accepted medi cal use but permits reclassification of marijuana and its subsequent use when and if its medicinal benefits can be demonstrated under the procedures of the controlled substances act finally although the issue was not raised in oakland cannabis buyers cooperative the lower federal courts initially appeared divided over whether the first amendment right to free speech shields physicians who prescribe or otherwise recommend marijuana to their patients court in the northern district of california granted preliminary injunction enjoining federal authorities fro m prosecuting physicians for such conduct the order also prohibited fe deral authorities from revoking the physicians registration to prescribe controlled substances and from excluding them from medicaremedicaid participation for such conduct the court subsequently made th injunction permanent in an unpublished opinion it found serious questions as to whether the federal enforcement policy permitted contentbased restriction on speech and whether it was unconstitutionally vague court in the district of columbia on the other hand refused to issue similar injunction from the dc c ourts perspective there ar first amendment protections for speech that is used as an integral pa rt of conduct in viola tion of valid criminal statute therefore even though st ate law may allow for the prescription orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20998crs6 recommendation of medicinal marijuana within its borders to do so is still violation of federal law the fact that speech or writing is the mechanism used by physicians to carry out such task does not make the conduc t less violative of fede ral law the first amendment does not prohibit the federal government from taking action against physicians whose prescription or recommendatio n of medicinal marijuana violates the act the ninth circuit muted the prospect of conflict when it held that while the first amendment precludes punishing doctors simp ly because they recommend that their patients use marijuana it did not preclude puni shment of doctor w ho intends his patient to use the recommendation to acquire mar ijuana in violation of federal law related legislative activity state medical marijuana initiatives have pr ovoked mixed response in congress including proposals to require the attorney genera l to revoke the controlled s ubstance registration of any practitioner who recommended marijuana for medical purposes bar those who recommend marijuana for medical purposes from participating in medicare and state health care programs clarify and increase the penalties applicable to controlled substance act violations by registrants make mandatory in those states with medical marijuana exception the discretionary denial of fede ral benefits for those convict ed of controlled substance offenses make it clear that controlled substa nce act provisions continue to apply notwithstanding the massage of
