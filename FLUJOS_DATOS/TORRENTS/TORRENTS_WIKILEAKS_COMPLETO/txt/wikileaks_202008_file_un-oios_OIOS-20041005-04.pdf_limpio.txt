abzamcm200 and abzamls401 with expenditure of us 163 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented by care international canada care expenditure of us 13 million int ernational federation of the red crosszambia red cross society ifrc expenditure of us 13 million world vision international wvi expenditure of us 13 millio n aktion afrika hilfe aah expenditure of us 1 million lutheran world federa tion lwf expenditure of us 2 million and african humanitarian action aha ex penditure of us 18 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr w ith expenditure of us 5 million 2 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th regional representation in zambia and sos mongu and kawambwa with administrative budgets totalling us 36 million for 2002 and 2003 and assets with an acquisition value of us 78 million and current value of us 22 million the number of staff working for the hcr operation in zambia was 108 this included staff on regular posts and united nations volunteers 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data review of implementation of subprojects in the field visits to camps and review of the availabl documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 9 for the six implementing partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with the subagreements oios assessed that internal control s of all partners were generally in place and operating effectively for care and lwf however there were some difficul ties in verifying the correctness of the expenditure charge d to unhcr as numerous adjustment and transfer entries were made oios also found that ca re overcharged unhcr for headquarters support costs and staffing costs an issue that is dealt with in more detail below 10 the representation had received audit cert ificates for all partners local and international for africare ymca and ministry of h ome affairs partners not included in the scope of the audit qualified audit opinions were xpressed for the others unqualified audit opinions were expressed but in some cases the opin ion included an except for clause highlighting certain weaknesses with the exception of care partners have addressed the concerns raised by the external auditors care international canada 11 care is longer partner of unhcr in za mbia cares withdrawal from unhcr funded activities has for the most part been amicab though few vital outstanding issues have not been resolved satisfactorily one of these rela tes to cares insistence in charging 85 per cent shared costs an item of expenditure not autho rised in the subproject budget according to care shared costs arise from direct services by c ares office in lusaka to unhcr funded projects allocated on fair share basis and rep resent incountry charges for administration and management oios does not agree with the apportionment of such additional charges and maintains that the incountry expenses for administ ration and management were already adequately provided by unhcr under other budget lin in the absence of budget line explicitly enabling the charge to unhcr of shared costs such costs should not have been apportioned to unhcr oios also noted that shared c osts were objected to by the representation but care persistently included such charges in the spmrs 12 for instance under sub project 01abzam cm201a care had claimed k 340 million approximately us 89800 under agency ope rational support though the budget for that line was only k 32 million us 8500 this r epresented over expenditure that was ten times the budget the difference of k308 million us 81300 represented shared costs charged by care to unhcr for which there was bud getary provision also under sub project 01abzamcm201a us 42629 had been cha rged for 5 per cent headquarters 3 support costs against budget of us 32574 imply ing an over expenditure of us 10000 the overcharges on account of shared costs and 5 pe r cent support costs totalled us 91355 in oios opinion therefore an amount of us 9135 5 should not have been accepted as bonafide charges and should be refunded to unhcr positive action needs to be taken to resolve this issue as more than two years has elaps ed since the end of liquidation period and the project is overdue for closure the shared cos ts for 2002 2003 could not be assessed and clearly identified as these were distributed ac ross several budget lines oios considers this method of cost allocation as nontransparent nd not easily amenable to audit scrutiny 13 care argued that overall the budget had not been ex ceeded and stated that during 2001 the regional representation had agreed that t hey could charge such support costs documentary evidence however was provided for this assertion and the regional representation denied that they had granted permiss ion to charge these costs the regional representation in zambia added that they would cont inue to pursue this matter with care to close the pending subproject 14 under subproject 02abzamls401a car charged unhcr an amount of us 18126 which reportedly was for garage income shortfall for cares lusaka garage this amount represented undercharges detected durin g cares internal audit that were divided among cares donors in oios view this di d not represent legitimate charge to unhcr and unless it is clearly justified as unhcr s ubproject expenditure it should be recovered the regional representation agreed to raise the iss ue once more with care 15 care persistently disregarded the subproj ect budgets with significant over expenditures recorded for example against one of the salary budgets of us 59000 some us 134000 more than twice the budget was charge d other examples can be cited this over expenditure generally arose as care paid highe r salaries and allowances to staff than the amount unhcr budgeted oios would reiterate th at if care wanted to pay higher salaries than mutually agreed in the signed subagr eement they should have topped up the salaries from their own resources at this stage oi is not recommending recovery but the regional representation when they saw this trend merging should have discussed and resolved this issue with the partner instead of sub sequently accepting consistent overcharges recommendations head2right the unhcr bureau for africa in conjunction with the ngo liaison unit should followup with care internation canada headquarters on the issue of charges for shared co st and seek recovery of us 91355 for such cost which were ne ither budgeted for in the subprojects nor accepted as bo na fide expenditure by the representation in zambia rec01 head2right the unhcr regional representation in zambia should request care international canada to refund an amount of u s 18126 for garage income shortfall incorrectly charged s salary cost to the unhcr subproject unless it can be justified s bonafide unhcr subproject expenditure rec02 4 b lutheran world federation 16 oios recommended that the lwf camp constru ction activities be improved by the introduction of better monitoring procedures oios found that works were not always completed timely and in some instances the workmans hip was poor the high turnover in staff may have been factor contributing to the we aknesses identified the regional representation agreed that the monitoring of constr uction activities was not adequate and they would ensure they were strengthened so that pr oblems are identified and corrected early 17 lwf was responsible for fleet management ctivities which consisted of number of garages at key locations important consolidated in formation which is crucial to effectively manage logistical operation was not maintained c entrally for example basic statistics on spare part inventory levels and the number and cost of repairs carried out were not available moreover at the time of the audit there were lar ge number of vehicles that were non operational due to poor maintenance and the lack of spare parts oios recommended that lwf significantly improve their vehicle management systems and procedures to ensure they are effective and information is reliable and upto date the regional representation stated unv will assume the responsibilities of fleet manag er and will be responsible for ensuring the lwf introduce improved procedures c world vision international 18 oios noted that some k 279 million us 62 000 was charged in the 2003 spmr for headquarters support costs instead of us 2600 0 representing the normal 5 per cent support cost charge wvis project implementation w as assessed as less than satisfactory project planning was poor and project monitoring an d evaluation was not adequate resulting in delays in the completion of the work for exampl the construction of seven staff houses at kawambwa was initiated in 2002 but the project was not fully completed until november 2003 the regional representation and the partner will im prove the monitoring of construction activities recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in zambia should recover from world vision international excess char ges for headquarters support costs amounting to us 36000 rec 03 the regional representation has initiated action by requesting wvi to refund us 36000 and submit revised spmr d african humanitarian action 19 six expatriate staff were funded under the subproject this was more than the personnel budgeted and funded under other partners for comparable activities the staffing levels were excessive and with the cost f expatriate salaries accounting for 28 per cent of the expenditure oios recommended th at the staffing levels be reviewed with the aim to reducing them aha was of the opinion that the international staff were required for accountabilit follow up and professional 5 responsibility the regional representation stated that the deployment of international staff would depend upon the gradual p hasing out of the project oios accepts the requirement of minimum complement of expatriate staff but maintained the opinion that one expatriate post per camp instead of two is sufficient b other programme issues programme and performance monitoring 20 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring by the regional representation was adequately performed the functi on however required to be improved by so mongu for example oios noted three instances where unhcr had advanced money totalling to some us 28300 to two government depa rtments and the zambian national service for the construction and rehabilitation of roads but the works were either not completed in time or abandoned midway the regional representation stated that the matter was being pursued with the provincial secretary and the zambia national service for satisfactory resolution b headquarters support cost 21 the eligibility to 5 per cent headquarters support costs for international ngos had not been correctly determined for example some subpr ojects contained large elements of local procurement that should have been excluded for the calculation also for most international ngos there was little evidence that they were contr ibuting to the subproject and hence eligible for the 5 per cent headquarter support cos ts the regional representation stated that all international ngos provided unhcr with informat ion in writing on the resources they planned to contribute to the refugee programme c supply management procurement 22 the documentation of the procurement proce ss was assessed as less than satisfactory and it was observed that procurement lists and prop er filing systems were not maintained until the end of 2003 the regional representation also d id not maintain vendor list of potential and prequalified suppliers local contracts comm ittee lcc had been established which was also responsible for reviewing and approving pr ocurement undertaken by unhcrs offices in zimbabwe and malawi oios noted howeve r that the lcc exceeded its authority and certain purchases over us 100000 were not sub mitted to the headquarters committee on contracts also oios noted instances where cost effective purchasing particularly for vehicles and computers had not been ensured the regional representation acted promptly and introduced procedures to improve the procuremen t process frame agreements have been established for frequently purchased goods and services and vendor list has been compiled the regional representation also put in place compreh ensive procurement plan that will facilitate timely wellplanned and cost effective procurement from sms and other sources 23 in 2002 and 2003 the regional representati on purchased large number of computers and other equipment locally based on various price com parisons with those available through sms the united nations office at nairobi the unhcr rep resentation in kenya and the internet oios 6 noted that the regional representation at lusaka wa s overcharged by significant amounts in view of the nature of the findings oios has referred ce rtain cases to the inspector generals office b asset management 24 oios audit in 2001 highlighted the need fo r the regional representation to significantly improve asset management nonetheless in 2004 this was still found to be very weak area for example large number of asse ts with implementing partners were not recorded in assettrak some registered assets could not be found and proper administrative action had not been taken to dispose of the large n umber of assets lost or damaged due to accidents although physical inventory was being conducted at the time of the audit the previous one had only been done in 2002 also thre light vehicles were recorded in assettrak as having an acquisition value of us 375 000 each meaning that the asset data was overstated by more than us 1 million focal point for asset management had not been designated and responsibilities were divided betwe programme and administration the regional representation stated that following cri tical review of asset management the backlog of physical verification gs45s and lamb bmissions has been cleared to great extent c warehousing 25 oios reviewed the functioning of the regio nal emergency stockpile in lusaka which was managed by wvi the procedures and system s in place to control and monitor the stock movement were assessed as satisfactory howev er while the stock was insured for value of us 500000 oios noted that the first s sum insured was limited to only us 50000 the amount for which the insurer will be li able above this limit unhcr would not be compensated and would have to bear the loss in oios view the insurance policy coverage was inadequate and needed to be reexamine d the regional representation reviewed the insurance policy and increased the cov erage to the total value of the inventory c security and safety 26 the security measures appeared adequate t the unhcr offices all unhcr staff in zambia have completed the basic field security trai ning offices are not yet fully moss compliant although shatter resistant film has been ordered and the fire evacuation plan is under review by the regional representative d administration 27 in the areas of administration and finance with the exception of mip at the regional representation and expenditures incurred by som th unhcr offices in zambia generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w however some weaknesses were identified for which corrective action is required payment of daily subsistence allowance 28 consultant hired through unhcr headquart ers was paid dsa of us 17000 for mission lasting 8 months although the travel auth orization referred to the reduction in dsa rates after period of 120 days this was not done and the consultant continued to receive the full daily amount oios recommended that the claim be reexamined and recoveries made as appropriate the regional representation agreed that reduced r ate should have applied 7 they will followup on the matter with the person uthorising the payment as they did not know the present whereabouts of the consultant b medical insurance plan mip 29 proper assessment could not be conducted of mip as all the pertinent documents could not be located and therefore number of the higher valued claims could not be audited overall therefore assurance could not be taken as to the adequacy and correctness of the reimbursement of this entitlement 30 oios review of the claims available noted that many of them were not adequately supported with original documents outlining the tre atment provided or drugs or medicines prescribed most of the claims were simply supporte d by an invoice and in some cases cash receipt document showing only the total fees charg ed by the hospitalclinic in such circumstances it was not possible to ascertain the completeness and the correctness of the claims processed 31 moreover in many cases the amounts reimbu rsed were incorrect highlighting the lack of an effective screening process and due regard fo r the mip rules and statutes for instance in many claims the entire hospital receipt was rei mbursed at 100 per cent including the doctorsconsultants fees that can only be reimburse d at 80 per cent criteria or standards to screen medical expenses had been established to ens ure the claims were reasonable and customary for the duty station in the absence of such control staff were paying different amounts for the same medical treatment and there wa s assurance that reimbursements for out of country expenses were based on rates that were reasonable and customary at the duty station the regional representation has improved the filing and documentation of mip claims new human resources assistant has been tr ained on the system and the finance officer has been given the responsibility of review ing all claims the issue of standard rates of treatment is being followed up with the undp and unhcr pretoria c medevac 32 attention was required with regard to mede vac cases important control documentation necessary for monitoring medevacs was not systematically prepared and the filing of medevac cases required improvement s many of the papers were misfiled with the mip files payment of dsa was not regulate d correctly for local staff for incountry medevacs and claims relating to some international medevacs had not been settled with advances still outstanding the regional representation stated that the discrep ancies of earlier years would be addressed and the payment of dsa regulated in accordance with the appropriate instructions d other matters 33 oios commended the efforts made by the reg ional representation to clear the outstanding receivables however oios review of the recovery of costs associated with the use of unhcr vehicles for private purposes noted th at procedures were not consistent countrywide instead of recovering mileage costs fo r private use based on actual kilometres driven the regional representation in lusaka prefe rred to make recoveries at lumpsum rate of us 90 per month this decision was taken t avoid the difficulties that arise in the actual monitoring of private usage the suboffices were however inclined to making 8 recoveries on the basis of actual private use of hcr vehicles oios recommended that the method of cost recovery for private usage of unhcr vehicles be consistent countrywide the regional representation confirmed it would comply w ith unhcrs instructions and ensure consistent approach suboffice mongu 34 financial management and budgetary control was weak particularly during 2002 not only was the total obligation level exceeded but t he abcs also showed substantial excesses in seven chapters the 2003 abod expenditures were mostly within budgets though we noted that the overtime budget still was overspent by 25 per cent with respect to the 2002 abod oios concluded that due to weak internal cont rols the head of office did not ensure that disbursements were within limits of allocation s and approved obligation levels the regional representation assured oios that appropria action is being initiated to avoid over expenditures and to ensure that obligation lev els are not exceeded 35 soms expenditures on official travel for 2002 and 2003 were nearly us 250000 which was more than the expenditures incurred by th regional representation in lusaka and three times that reported by the other suboffice t kawambwa oios review of travel expenditures in mongu showed that lax internal cont rols poor management and frequent extensions of missions contributed to the high leve l of travel expenditures oios recommended that the level of travel required by st aff members assigned to som be reviewed as it appeared excessive and could not ways be justified moreover the internal controls over travel expenditures were weak as sta ff members regularly issued and approved their own travel authorisation and travel claims nd the higher dsa rate was claimed without accompanying hotel receipts oios recommended that internal controls be strengthened the regional representation has taken steps to address oios concerns they have stopped the practice of the issuance of monthly travel authoriz ations which oios felt gave too much flexibility to staff to make their own travel plans 36 som did not enforce proper controls over c ommunications expenditure that totalled some us 92000 for 2002 and 2003 the communicatio ns budget was overspent by 26 per cent us 10525 in 2002 though expenditures were within the budget in 2003 telephone logs were not properly kept international telephon lines were readily accessible and unusually long private calls to international desti nations were made frequently exceeding 30 minutes from selected bills amounting to some us 22000 oios identified that most of them were for private purposes however recover had been initiated this was matter of concern and as oios only analysed selected bills the actual amounts to be recovered would be significant oios recommended the establi shment of proper monitoring and billing system the restriction of international di alling facility implementing controls to ensure private calls are kept to minimum and cond ucting thorough review of previous bills to identify private calls in order to control the rising cost of communications oios suggested the installation of the pama system the regional representation has purchased billing system and once installed they will also maintain manual log costs relating to outstanding private telephone calls will be recover ed and instructions have been issued to limit the number and duration of telephone calls the regional representation will seek approval for the implementation of pama 37 also som needed to ensure compliance with unhcr rules and procedures with regard to hospitality expenditure overtime payment s and staff members residential security 9 costs the regional representation stated they would ensur that such costs would be regulated strictly in accordance with instructions f field office solwezi 38 there were number of shortcomings in the administration and management of the field office solwezi fos som was responsible for the overall supervision and management of the administration activities of fos this arrangement however was not working effectively as they were 14 hours apart c onsequently the representation in lusaka took over the responsibility to process the expendi tures against som mongus abod but this was done after considerable time lag oios recommended that better and more practical working arrangement was necessary and co nsidering the level of expenditure incurred by fos which accounted for more than qu arter of soms expenditures this was considered priority 39 for fos overall significant improvement ver administrative matters were warranted overtime payments were not correctly calculated ad vances and deposits were charged directly to the abod overpayment for travel were made and s taff on mission received the higher rated dsa without adequate supporting documentation oios also noted that vat was paid on goods and services and procedures were in pla ce for the recovery of private telephone calls there was clear evidence that refunds due to unhcr were appropriately credited to the bank account and charges for petroldiesel wer misclassified under official travel 40 oios recommended that the regional represe ntation in zambia review the current organizational arrangements for supervision of fos the regional representation acknowledged the financial control constraints betw een som and fos and stated that the situation has been addressed through the recruitmen t of an adminfinance assistant f suboffice kawambwa 41 oios observed that the head of office was approving payments to himself the regional representation has now rectified this fuel management needed improvement and oios recommended that proper measuring devices be i nstalled closer monitoring and improved internal controls over inventory was also required action has been taken to improve controls v acknowledgement 42 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and
