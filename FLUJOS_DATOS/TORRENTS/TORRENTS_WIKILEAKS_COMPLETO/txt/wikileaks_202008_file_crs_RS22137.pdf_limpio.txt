this need4 law enforcement in particular has found da ta brokers useful as these pr ivate companies maintain and organize personal information on individuals in manner that may not be legally available to government actors5 the privacy act for example requires federal agencies to limit the amount of information on american c itizens that these agencies maintain and disseminate6 the act

suspects to former addresses neighbors etc19 as mentioned above the data brokerage industry has grown increasingly close to law enforcement and counterterrori sm agencies in the last few years and choicepoints relationship with law enforcement and counter terrorism agencies is indicative of this fact20 choicepoint has multimillion dollar contracts with the departments of homeland security and justice and the company ma intains federal agencyspecific websites to facilitate searches by officers from those agencies21 up until recently choicepoint guarded access to its information by requiring customers to provide business records on f ile with government agencies copies of drivers licenses and other information identifying customers as legitimate businesses unfortunately at least one criminal ring began creating sham businesses and identities in order to get around these requirements and angelesbased sting operation in 2004 uncovered evidence leading authorities to conclude that the ring had accessed choicepoints information on roughly 145000 people22 as the scandal unfolded choicepoint drew heated criticism for refusing to notify many of those whose personal information had
