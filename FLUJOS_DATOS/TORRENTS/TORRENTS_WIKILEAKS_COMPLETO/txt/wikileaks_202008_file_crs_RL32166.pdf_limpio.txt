growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers spending on longterm care by both the public and priv ate sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for pe rsons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost two thirds of all spending by far the primary payer for longterm care is the fe deralstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all l ongterm care spending in 2001 many states have devoted significant fforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care by persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care chiefly by medicaid still dominates most states spending for l ongterm care today to ssist congress understand issues that states face in providing longterm care services crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 this report presents b ackground and analysis about longterm care in maine maine is one of the smallest states in the country with 13 million people in 2000 it is also one of the oldest states with 144 of its population aged 65 and older by 2025 over onefifth of its population will be 65 and older medicaid spending for longterm care in maine in fy2001 was 411 million almost onethird of all medi caid spending in part due to the aging population and because of 1993 budgetary crisis involvi ng rapidly escalating medicaid nursing home costs maine has pursued an aggr essive policy to decrease dependence on nursing homes between 1995 and 2001 the percentage of public longterm care funding devoted to these facilities decreased from 84 to 61 moreover the state has decreased reliance on large stateoperated residential facilities for persons with mental retardation in favor of smaller communitybased facilities maines efforts to reduce reliance on institutional care has been in part due to expanded use of medicaids home and communitybased waiver program as well as multiple state funded programs crs interviews with state officials and review of state reports highlighted maines reliance on medicaid maximiza tion policy under which the state makes every effort to draw down federal medicaid dollars by incorporating in its state plan almost all the home and communitybased services options allowed by federal law one of the challenges the state faces during tight fiscal constraints is to hold on to the gains it has made in providing home nd community services to people with disabilities the 10state study was funded in part by grants from the jewish healthcare foundation and the us department of health and human services health resources and services administration offi ce of rural health policy this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32166preface demographic challenges posed by th growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending lmost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost tw othirds of all spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the fe deralstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all us longterm care spending in 2001 federal and state medicaid spending for longterm care in fy2001 was about 75 billion representing over onethird of all medicaid spending over 70 of medicaid longterm care spending was for institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system paid through medicaid is structurally biased in favor of institutional care state governments face significant challenges in refocusing care systems given the structure of current federal fina ncing many states have devoted significant efforts to change their longterm care systems to expand home and communitybased services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental appr oach to longterm care without major federal policy i nvolveme nt leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and communitybased care within existing federal funding constrai nts and program rules to help congress review various policy lternatives and to assist policymakers understand issues that states face in deve lopment of longterm care services the congressional research service crs undert ook study of ten states in 2002 the research was undertaken to look at state policies on long term care as well as trends in both institutional

introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct paymen ts made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benef its and vendor payments made by states with federal matchi ng payments on behalf of i ndividuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care

for nursing home care grew by 50 in the threeyear period beginning in 1967 in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care facilities for the mentally retardedskilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry sign ificant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 nd the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about17000 nursing homes with 18 million beds 3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that wa s becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of th eir state medicaid plan s effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of healt h education

1915c home and communitybased services waivers by carol oshaughnessy and rachel kelly undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of nursing facility care but also to respond to the desires of persons w ith disabilities to remain in their homes and in community settings rather than in in stitutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative ac tion to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it aut horized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medi caid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the fact that the medicaid program had emphasized institutional care rather than care in home and communitybased settings services under the section 1915c waiver incl ude case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitati on environmental modifications among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their waiver programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing f acility care services and care for persons with mental retardation in intermediate care facilities icfsmr despite this disparity in spending in many states the section 1915c waiver program is the primary source of financial

community services to people with disabilities while dealing with its fiscal constraints the labor shortage is critical problem affecting all areas of healthcare including longterm care for older persons and care for persons with developmental disabilities particularly in southern maine the labor shortage also makes it difficult to recruit state and privately employed case managers much of the

institutional care maine has pursued an aggressive po licy to decrease dependence on nursing homes in its longterm care system the state started on this course because of 1993 budgetary crisis since nursing home co sts had increased by 50 over 3year period9 the state implemented stringent functional eligibility criteria for medicaid nursing home care in 1994 prior to impleme ntation of these criteria people had been able to obtain medicaid nursing home coverage if they needed assistance with one activity of daily living adl or one instrumental activity of daily living iadl10 according to some stakeholders the new criteria resulted in some people being released to or remaining in th community without sufficient home and community service alternatives according to interviewees the alzheimers association succeeded in amending the functional criteria for nursing home eligibility to define nursing need to include management of cognition and behavior the standard now requires an applicant to need form of therapy 5 days week assistance with three specific adls nursing services three times week or have cognitive or behavior problem in 1994 the maine legislature adopted policy of universal preadmission screening of all nursing home applicants so facilities cannot admit anyone unless they first have an assessment the state found that there were not enough residential alternatives to nursing homes and that waiting lists for home and community services had developed to ameliorate this situation in 1996 the state devoted more funding to home and community services as result medicaid nursing home admissions decreased and use of home and community services increased tables 4 and 5 between 1995 and 2001 the percen tage of publiclyfunded aged and disabled longterm

which required that state medicaid nursing home payment rates be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities section 1902a13 of the social security act enabled the state to control payments to nursing homes and avoid paying unnecessary costs nursing home quality is said to be gene rally good according to interviewees since many homes are located in rural ar eas where people know one another well the resulting sense of community promotes deliv ery of good quality care in some rural communities the facilities are major employer in the area trends in home and communitybased care maine takes advantage of medicaids manda tory and optional state plan services as well as section 1915c waivers to provide home and communitybased care to adults with disabilities in fy2001 the state provided about 5000 participants with the following medicaid state plan servi ces private duty nursing home health personal care and

thingsthe state also sponsors number of pr ograms that do not receive federal funding most of which serve just few hundr ed people by far the largest program is homebased care which served bout 4000 people at cost of 15 million in fy2001 this program and the states ot her home and communitybased programs for adults have separate consumerdirected components that mirror the main programs medicaid state plan serv ices and 1915 c waivers maines medicaid mandatory and optiona l longterm services have varying functional eligibility standards but all have the same financial eligibility standards under the states medicaid program persons countable income cannot exceed 100 of the federal povert level countable assets cannot exceed 200011 although the state can disregard an dditional 8000 in

is 90 of the average nursing f acility payment as of june 2003 the state was considering exploring an amendment to its medicaid waiver that would increase the cost cap the waiver served 279 par

component of group residential care for 4325 participants in fy2001 at co st of 451 million state funds paid for the room and board component for most participants accounting for 17 million in the same year the state expanded this program as it sought to increase alternatives to nursing home care during its budget crisis in the mid1990s medicaid finances the care component of services in residential care homes adult family care homes and residential care homes which have private or shared rooms and baths and assisted living facilities which have private apartments medicaid payments for residents of all residential facilities are adjusted for varying categories 15 casemix groups using st andardized assessmen t of all residents assisted living facility residents receive an average

over 10000 as cop ayment for residential care state programs there are number of pathways that establish medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased longterm care services these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32166crs17 coverage of persons whose income is 300 of the federal supplemental security income ssi payment level as allowe d under the section 1915c waiver program 1656 month for an individual in 2003 despite the availability of this more liberal standard many people may need community care but ca nnot meet medicaids income limits or resource tests many of these persons cannot establish eligibility until they spenddown almost all of their resources and income to meet that eligibility level and by that time may be in danger of entering an institution one of the issues many states have confronted is how to serve these people maine has addressed this i ssue in part through its ven statefunded programs many of these programs are designed to complement their medicaid counterparts with more generous financial eligibility standards than those of medicaid by far the largest program is homebased care for adults aged 18 and over eligibility for services is based on the presence of limitations in adls and iadls with at least one being an adl or if th ey need direction with four adls the program has upper limits on participants incomes or assets however the program has copayment of 4 of mont hly income and 3 of assets exceeding 15000 the program offers wide array of services including case management nursing home health aide therapies persona l care and adult day care these are the same basic services provided under the der and adult waiver there are four levels of care with corresponding maximum cap s the cap on services for the highest level is 85 of the nursing facility rate elder independence of maine runs the program which served 3863 persons in fy2001 at cost of 124 million in addition the program has sepa ratelymanaged consumerdirected

overview services to persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in the united states changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th century as result of number of converging factors these include the advocacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individua ls through supplemental security income ssi and supplemental security disability insurance ssdi and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with mental retardation12 trends in institutional care the early history of services to persons with mental retardation is characterized by the development of large state institu tions or training schools begun during the latter part of the 19th century and continuing through the first part of the 20th century between 1920 and 1967 ins titutions quadrupled in size and peaked at almost 200000 individuals nationwide in 165 fr eestanding stateoperated mental retardation institutional facilities13 today some states are still faced with the legacy of large stateoperated institutions maine has eliminated its sole large stateoperated facility for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities it is also making strides to downsize its other three smaller stateoperated

issues in longterm care in maine the following discussion highlights selected issues raised in state reports collected for this report and in interviews with state officials and key stakeholders conducted during the site visit to maine in the summer of 2002 budgetary concerns in dealing with prior budgetary dilemmas the state has followed medicaid maximization po licy in providing home and community based care that is because the state s opted to take opport unities to provide number of optional home and communitybased services that are allowed under the federal law it can therefore draw down fe deral medicaid matching dollars to support its program one of the challenges the state faces dur ing its budgetary crisis is to hold on to the gains it has made in providing home and community services to people with disabilities according to interviewees this is particularly the case when the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32166crs27 15 rankin joe governor proposes nursing home tax kennebec journal june 29 2002 16 michael d moore health professionals wary of king cuts bangor daily news june 27 2002nursing home lobby competes with other groups for funding part of the state governments plan to close its budget ga p would involve 6 nursing home bed tax which would raise 7 million15 the money would be used to draw down federal medicaid funds which would then go to wages for longterm care workers including providers other than nursing homes other budget actions would shift some st ate funded residential costs to medicaid and reduce spending on statefunded serv ices including homemaker adult day services and alzheimers respite care the gover nors budget proposal would decrease nursing facilities cost of living adjustment from 3 to 216 according to state officials as of march 2002 home and communitybased services had not been affected too negatively by budget cuts labor issues the health labor shortage is critical problem affecting all areas of health care including longterm care and care for persons with developmental disabilities particularly in southern maine the labor shortage also makes it difficult to recruit state and privatelyemployed case managers interviewees cited several reasons for th labor shortage fourteen percent of maines population is aged 65 or over and ma ny younger people are leaving the state to find employment interviewees also cite d low wages and lack of health insurance as barriers to employment in the longterm care sector the state has considered becoming selfinsurer for agencies contracting with the state to provide an opportunity for them to participate in large group health insurance plan the results of the labor shortage incl ude high staff turnover and reliance on temporary agency staff this can disrupt continuity of care in facilities and lead to staff having insufficient training to ndle some of the complex needs of nursing home residents there is also shortage of experienced nursi ng home administrators so many come to their jobs with very little training state officials said that some people in southern maine may have to be placed on waiting lists for home and community services because of the labor shortage conducting criminal background checks on longterm care employees is another controversial labor issue in maine not all longterm care programs require criminal background checks for longterm care workers and consumerdirected programs have actively resisted this the states certified nurse aide registry does not allow people who have committed crimes in health care settings to be on the registry but criminals with other types of convictions can be some offi cials recommended more attention to registries of nurse aides state officials noted that uswide registry could prevent criminals working in longterm care from going from state to state when they lose their credentials consumer direction number of controversial issues raised during the site visit related to various aspects of the cons umerdirected programs control of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32166crs28 programs was transferred from the maine department of human services dhs to the department of labor dol in 2001 th transfer occurred as result of advocacy efforts on the part of consumers many believed that maine dol would be the more appropriate administering agency since it has experience with rehabilitation services and independent living services for persons with severe disabilities dol administers programs authorized under the rehabilitation act of 1973 including vocational rehabilitation and centers for independent living programs another controversy surrounds paying family members to work for beneficiaries according to interviewees this can become problematic when the family members come to consider the payments part of their rights and income and when families provide inadequate or substandard services there is also the feeling among some that women who receive paym ent will become the next generation of poor women because they do not have acce ss to employment that provides fringe benefits like retirement and health insurance assisted living facilities some stakeholders interviewed said that assisted living facilities alfs are becoming more popular than nursing homes however sometimes people enter nursing homes because federal money isnt available for assisted living facilities also assisted living facilities are supposed to provide personal care as part of the payment they receive from medicaid but some do not the alf regulations give residents the right to age in place but providers say that this is not reflected in the level of medicaid reimbursement they receive waiting list as of the summer of 2002 the waiting list for residential care for persons with developmental disabilities was 500 people who are in crisis situations move off of the list to receive services first the waiting list for supported employment was between 300 and 400httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32166 crs29 appendix 1 major home and communitybased longterm care programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities in maine programtarget groupfunctional eligibility
