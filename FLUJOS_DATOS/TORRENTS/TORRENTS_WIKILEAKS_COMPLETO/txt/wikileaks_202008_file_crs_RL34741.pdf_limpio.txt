drilling in or under the great lakes in c ontrast to us law canadian law permits onshore gas and oil drilling under the great lakes and offshore gas drilling in the great lakes some contend that the decision of whether to ban drilling is state responsibility the states have the author ity to regulate the use of great lakes resources within their territory and have instituted variety of approaches for dealing with oil and gas drilling yet congress has broad authority to regulate both the navigable waters and oil and gas development some critics of federal action to prohibit drilling say that while congress may have the authority to regulate or ban oil and gas drilling in or under the great lakes such action might also constitute taking of property for which ju st compensation would be

resolution of 2003 pl 1087 4 section 504 of the consolidated appropriations act of 2005 pl 108447drilling in the great lakes background and issues introduction the debate over how to regulate offshore oil and gas drilling in the united states has generated public and congressional interest much discussion has centered on existing and potential drilling operations along the outer continental shelf the debate has also reached specific regions within the united states including the great lakes the question of whether to allo w oil and gas drilling under the great lakes has been contested within states bordering the great lakes and in congress some opposed to drilling under the great lake s are concerned about the potential environmental economic and public health consequences of drilling they contend that drilling will raise the risks of oil sp ills hazardous gas leaks and pollution that may harm lakeside residents and the great lakes ecosystem proponents of drilling contend that the risks of oil spills and ot her accidents are extremely low due to new technologies that drilling would not be nvironmentally harmful and that it would lead to the generation of revenues dditional employment and expanded domestic energy supplies obtaining permits for drilling under the gr eat lakes has largely been banned by various state and federal laws great lakeswide ban may have initially been driven by the signing of statement of principle against oil drilling in the great lakes by eight great lakes governors in 19851 all states viewed this nonbinding agreement as prohibiting drilling for natural gas and oil in the lakes and with the exception of michigan as prohibiting directional drilling2 various states have enacted permanent or temporary bans against drilling the federal government became involved in banning drilling in the great lakes when the congress enacted temporary ban on the federal and state issuance of permits for drilling under the great lake s in 2001 pl 10766 title v 503 extended it in 20033 and then again through 20074 some also proposed permanent ban against drilling in or under the great kes permanent ban on issuing

in the energy polic act of 2005 pl 10958 section 386 specifically states that federal or state permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant directional or offshore dr illing in or under one or more of the great lakes5 the us ban on drilling in the great lakes has generated controversy some contend that the decision of whether to drill in the great lakes should be made by each state bordering the lakes they view federal ban on drilling in the great lakes as violation of states rights and suggest that federal ban constitutes taking6 some proponents of the ban c ontend that state laws are not uniform in permanently banning drilling in the lakes indeed as described later in this report some great lakes states have enacted permanent bans on providing new oil and gas drilling permits in state waters other states have bans and some are considering permanent bans in pending legislation offshore and directional drilling for ga s under the canadian great lakes is allowed by

in the state of ohio the ohio general assembly provided the policy framework to allow for the extraction of oil and gas from under lake erie and l easing and production procedures were established by the oh io department of natural resources12 however opposition to drilling in lake erie began in 1957 because of environmental concerns and the prog ram was abandoned by 196813 offshore or onshore wells were drilled in lake erie in ohio state waters afterwards and several temporary bans were placed on all types of drilling under lake erie in oh io the latest one in 200314 in pennsylvania there

highest for michigan and ohio with majorityof the estimated resources in lake erie potential consequences of drilling there are several potential consequences associated with oil and gas drilling in or near large waterbodies such as the gr eat lakes possible negative effects include oil spills discharge of contaminated drilling fluids and effects of the footprint of the drilling infrastructure23 possible positive effects include increased revenues for the region and state increased employme nt and greater domestic energy production under 503 of the energy and water ppropriations act ewa of

under the great lakes and provide da ta where available on unintended oil and gas releases into the great lakes economic consequences drilling under the great lakes can have both benefits and costs for local regional and state economies explora tion for oil and gas deposits may yield economic benefits such as j obs and revenue for the owner if deposits are not found and drilling is not fully implemented these benefits may be shortterm if deposits are significant and drilling commences and expands local and state governments would also benefit from revenues generated from permits leases and taxes on the quantity of oil and gas sold in some great lakes states revenues from oil and gas leases potentially benefit the environment for example in michigan some revenues from leasing rights

habitats sp ills or toxic di scharges may degrade water quality lower dissolved oxygen contaminate sediments and alter aquatic vegetation37 water flow influences the potential impact of spills in areas where there is high flow of water eg rivers impacts will be less but potentially more widespread than in areas where water flow is minimal such as in wetlands in lowflow areas spills can persist longer and damage vegetation and other organisms that use these habitats38 in the great lakes water flow is variable and therefore spills can have different impacts for instance water that enters lake superior takes approx imately 182 years to be comple tely replaced this could be considered lowflow area compared to lake erie and lake ontario which take approximately three and six ears respectively to replace water toxins from spills in the great lakes can settle into sediments and persist for many years directional drilling the type of drilling operation is factor when assessing its potential environmental c onsequences for example in michigan there has been debate over the potential environmental eff ects of directional drilling directional drilling is considered to have less potential hazard than offshore drilling due primarily to its location onshore39 see figure 2 directional drilling beneath the great lakes in michigan for example targets the niagaran reefs formation which is four to five thousand feet below ground there is an impermeable geologic barrier between the hydrocarbon deposits and the lake40 according to an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of directional drilling there is little risk of contaminating the great lakes through spills at the reservoir and well however the study states that there is potential risk associated with leaks at the wellhead which would be located onshore41 this study also recommended that directional drillin g under the great lakes be done at least 1500 feet from the shoreline and prohi bited in sensitive natural areas directional drilling would likely mitigate the risk of spills into the great lakes however it is uncertain how much of the fossil fuel resources can be extracted with current directional

world history the ixtoc i estimated at 140 million gallons was due to an oil well blowout in mexican gulf coast waters in 1979 1969 well blowout off the coas t of santa barbara released approximately 4 million gallons into the environment and has been credited with catalyzing some of the landmark environmental legislation of the 1970s 47 for information regarding this technology see american

multidimensional representations of those surfaces these images can be analyzed to find the best location for drilling 49 american petroleum institute at http wwwapiorgehs waterdirectionaldrillcfm 50 ibid 51 ibidwaters45 the canadian spill figures are notewor thy however as mentioned above canada only allows directional drilling thus making spill into the great lakes more unlikely than offshore well locations offshore oil exploration and production in the great lakes would increase the risk of oil spills in the region the risk of oil well blowouts is relatively low46 major blowout has not occurred in us wa ters in decades which industry advocates attribute to advancements in drilling technology47 advances in drilling technology have led to decreases in spills and releases and lower footprints for drilling rigs according to some industry advocates threedimensiona l seismic imaging technology48 for example allows explorers to identify areas where commercial quantities of oil and gas ma have accumulated this technology provides greater rate of success in finding oil and gas posits and therefore could reduce the number of exploratory wells used to tap deposits49 in some drilling operations slimhole drilling is employed slimhole drilling is defined as drilling the smallest hole size to meet production objectives in the most costeffective manner this method decreases waste volumes and takes up as much as 75 less surface area than traditional wells50 other innovations include modular rigs which lower the footprint of drilling as well as pipeline sensors that

directiona l drilling under certain circumstances but the laws amendment would appear to indicate that such authority has been removed73 legal implications of federal drilling ban as described above absent federal law to the contrary states have the authority to regulate the use of great lakes resources within their territory and have instituted variety of approaches for dealing with oil and gas drilling within their respective boundaries still the federal government does have certain authorities at its disposal to regulate the use of great lakes resources as well which it has exercised by banning new leases and permits related to great lakes oil and gas development congress has broad author ity under the comme rce clause of the constitution to regulate both the navigable wate rs and oil and gas development74 while congress likely possesses the authority to regulate or ban oil and gas drilling in or under the great lakes such action might also constitute taking of private property for which just compensation would be required75 the legal analysis court would likely undertake in determining whether taki ng has occurred is described below preliminary issue is whether the federal ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting would be covered by federal navigational servitude as stated in the sla states title to the navigable waters is subject to the navigational servitude

successful taking claim can be established the action alleged to constitute taking must be authorized by congress and must be for public use both of these conditions would likely be satisfied in the case of congressional ban on great lakes drilling in general the public use requirement has been deemed relatively low hurdle and will likely be met if the govern ment action is in the public interest see for example kelo v city of new london 125 sct 2655 2005 the public use requirement is rarely an issue when takings are performed by the federal government along these lines it seems likely that multiple justif ications for banning great lakes drilling would satisfy the test such as the encouragement of more efficient oil and gas production or the prevention of environmental harmthat the property interest held by the state is subject to dominant federal right to act in the interests of navigation76 thus under its commerce clause authority when congress regulates waters for their navigability property right is not taken within the meaning of the fifth amendment and compensation is due77 the exact limits of the navigational servitude and whether the regulation or banning of drilling in or under the great lakes is sufficiently relate d to navigability are unclear the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that when regulating the navigable waters the navigational servitude applies despite regulatory purpose that is unrelated to navigation78 under this broad interpreta tion the current ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting in or under the great lakes may not cons titute taking however the court of appeals for the fede ral circuit as well as the supreme court has held that the navigati onal servitude applies only wh the government has bona fide navigational grounds for its regulation79 it is arguable that drilling ban could be based on navigationa l grounds for example the army corps of engineers has claimed that it has regulatory authority over both directional and vertical drilling in the navigable waters under the rivers and harbors act wh ich authorizes the corps to permit obstructions to navigability80 as the case law varies among the courts that have examined the issue and as it is not immediately clear whether ban on drilling would fall under the navigational servitude it is unclear whether this doctrine would prevent taking from occurring assuming the navigational servitude w ould not preclude fifth amendment taking additional analysis becomes necessary81 taking can occur in variety of manners and ban on leasin g or permitting and thus potential drilling like other forms of government regula tion could arguably constitute taking generally for court to find regulatory taking the regulation must result

permits remain valid until the well is sealed impairment of property interests82 the extent and nature of regulation necessary to establish taking under these circ umstances is however debatable83 as stated in the supreme courts penn central decision these determina tions are generally to be made on casebycase basis focused on analys is of several particularly significant factors namely the nature of the gove rnment action the economic impact of that action and the extent to which the re gulation has interfered with distinct investmentbacked expectations 84 in addition it would appear that generally the economic impact and interference with investmentbacked expectations must be severe for regulation to constitute taking85 takings analysis in this particular context is complicated by the numerous entities with existing property rights in great lakes oil and gas resources the current leaseholders who may or may not be presently engaged in drilling and the states themselves person who acquired lease pr ior to the enactment of the federal ban has obtained right as expressed in the lease that is considered property for fifth amendment purposes86 assuming that the navigati onal servitude does not preclude taking total ban on drilling which would effectively re nder an oil and gas lease valueless might constitute taking as in general the more narrow the property right held the easier it is to prove that taking has occurred however the federal ban currently in pl ace does not appear to affect leases or permits issued prior to the enactment of the 2005 energy policy act thus leaseholders with permits in place that are now or might soon begin operating would not appear to have been subjected to taking of any property interest still it is arguable that permit renewal might now be banned by federal law87 further permits necessary for oil and gas development would likely not be issued to current leaseholders who had not obtained permits prior to the ban in these situations the leaseholders may be able to successfully argue that their property interests as expressed in the lease have been rendere d valueless and thus been subjected to taking whether this is the case however would depend on the facts specific to each of the leases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34741crs20 88 the supreme court has held that the referenc to private property in the fifth amendment

us 302 32627 2002 93 lucas 505 us at 1031whether the current federal ban on lease or permit issuance constitutes taking of the states property right appears more complex88 the states are seen to hold title to portions of the great lakes the lake bed and the minerals unde rlying the lakebed it is also arguable that the federal ban on future leasing effectively renders any oil and gas accumulations valueless unless oil nd gas can be extracted by nonlease arrangement eg contracting thus if court were to define the relevant property interest for purposes of takings analysis as the oil and gas estate alone it might conclude that taking would occur by virtue of leasing ban however this analysis may be complicated by the application of the whole parcel rule the whole parcel rule as explained by the supreme court in penn central states that taking jurisprudence does not divide single par cel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in particular segment have been entirely abrogated89 thus in that case regulation affecting only portion of the plaintiffs property leaving the rest unaffected did not constitute taking90 it is thus arguable that taking of the mineral interest does not result in fifth amendment taking because the whole parcel the totality of states rights in the great lakes remains otherwise unaffected while the whole parcel rule is backed by considerable precedent courts have been willing to sever certain property interests for takings analysis purposes and among those interests is the subsurface mineral estate91 most recently in tahoe sierra preservation council the us supreme court has indicated that it rejects conceptual severance of property rights lthough this case did not address severance of the mineral estate92 thus it remains unclear whet her taking of state property would be found as result of the current oil and gas leasing ban finally there is another possible argu ment for concluding that any ban on leasing permitting or drilling in or under the great lakes is not taking based on the supreme courts holding in lucas v south carolina coastal commission 93 under lucas taking does not occur even if th total

cases would seem to indicate that oil and gas drilling is not nuisance per but that the right circumstances could result in finding that drilling constitutes nuisance95 thus it may follow that the ban on leasing or permitting activities could constituteregulation of nuisance and that ta king has occurred however whether nuisance would exist in this case would ppear to depend on the specific issues drilling ban is intended to address conclusion oil and gas drilling under the great lakes is opposed by many who contend that the potential environmental risks associated with drilling do not justify the potential economic gain proponents of drilling however contend that risks associated with drilling are not high due to advances in drilling technology and safety and that drilling would provide jobs and income for the states where it is done congress has weighed in on these issues and enacted permanent ban on the issuance of new federal or state leases or permits for il and gas drilling in or under the great lakes this ban would only affect drilling in uscontrolled waters of the great lakes and would not affect canadian production
