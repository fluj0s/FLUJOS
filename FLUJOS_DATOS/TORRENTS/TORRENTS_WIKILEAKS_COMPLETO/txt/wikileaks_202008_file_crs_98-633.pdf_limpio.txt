and its arab and mu slim neighbors more acceptable in the latter circles israeliturkish ties are the most portentous development in this area and they have not been impeded by subsequent difficulties in the peace process the main dimension of turkishisraeli relations is military landmark agreements on military cooperation in february 1996 and on military industrial cooperation in april 1996 ve produced unprecedente d military exercises and training arms sales and strategic talks the civilian dimension of the new partnership is expanding rapidly s purred by 1996 free trade agreement and resulting increases in nonmilitary trade israeliturkish relations are founded on historical cordiality between turks and jews and are motivated by the selfinterest of each side turkey had been concerned about what it viewed as detrimental re percussions from possible israelisyrian peace agreement and wanted to be consulted it also sought to send cautionary message to damascus about its aid to the kurdistan workers party pkkwhich has been waging guerrilla war in southeas t turkey since 1984 and about unresolved disputes over water and territory moreove r turkey needed response to greeces policy of encircling it with military agreements including an unsubstantiated arrangement with syria finally the israeli connection enables turkey to circumvent us and european arms embargos and what it believes to be the influence of anti turkish ethnic lobbies in congress purchase of israeli arms allows turkey to avoid the strictures of politically conditioned eu ropean and us sales and possibly to mitigate the antiturkish policies of governme nts competing with israel to sell arms to turkey for its part israel initially perceived turkey as bridge to the arab and muslim worlds but also may have wanted to vent its frustrations over what it views as syrias intransigence in peace talks israel has found more lasting commonality with turkey on antiterrorism and in military and civilian trade there is only mild domestic dissent in turkey and israel over enhanced relations some governments in the region have reacted more forcefully syria viewing itself as the unstated target of the new allies has mobilized arab and islamic condemnation reached out to bag hdad to indicate possibilities of counter bloc but eventually opened dialogue with turkey egypts reaction has been moderate in bilateral talks with ankara but negative in multilateral arab and muslim forums jordan has attended some turkis hisraeli events but has pointedly noted that its actions were in response to inv itations from ankara not israel while the peace talks are stalled greek officials and some in cyprus are concerned that israeli military and intelligence assistance to turkey might eventually be used against them and direct their criticism to jerusalem the us government views israeliturkish relations positively as contributing to regional peace and stability possible eff ects on other us policy priorities in the region are not yet clear the usisraeli free trade agreement and the arms export control act may be implicated in indi vidual israeliturkish deals httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98633contents

past few years new international romance has been blossoming in the public eye as israeliturkish rela tions have developed in unprecedented ways this report is an overview of the change and begins with detailed examination of the military and civilian dimensions of the relationship bilateral military ties in particular have gene rated much controversy in the re gion an understanding of the dimensions of the bond provides the founda tion for an analysis of each partys motivations and of some regional criticism the report concludes with the outlook for us policy in light of the israeli turkish connection policy implications may not be as positive as us officials who have applauded enhanced ties between two close us allies as contributing to regiona l peace and security have suggested yet the israeliturkish link may have negative impact on the arabisraeli peace process on us influence with the ankara regime and on other policies of importance to us interests in the region

in modern times turkey was the first mu slim albeit officially secular country to recognize the independent state of israel in 1948 over the years the relationship was quiet one david ben gurion israels first prime minister advocated stronger ties with peripheral nations such as turkey iran and ethiopia geographically situated just beyond israels antagonistic arab neighbors the idea was never fully implemented turkey wit hdrew its ambassador from israel at the time of the suez crisis in 1956 but did not break relations not until after the persian gulf war were turkey and israel drawn to

daily news january 26 1998 online 8us state department patterns of global terrorism april 1998 onlinehistory may help explain why turkishisraeli ties have survived despite the impasse in the arabisraeli peace proce ss since 1996 and why some arab criticism has been both so scathing and without effect to some extent turkisharab relations have been more antagonistic than friendly turkey used to be the core of the ottoman empire ruler of arab domains and there is residual arab resentment of this overlordship some arabs hold the ottoma ns responsible for failing to stop the growth of the jewish community in palestine and thus for bestowing the zionist presence and arabisraeli conflict on the re gion as muslim brother modern day turkey has nonetheless expressed solidarity fo r the arab states in their conflicts with israel and in votes at the united nations it believes however that the arabs and iran have not reciprocated on issues that ankara considers vital national interests cyprus the turkish muslims in the greek region of thrace and the armenian conquest of territory of turkic azerbaijan motivations turkey turkey like israel has pursued the rela tionship out of self interest ankara likely wanted to avoid having its interests ignored by an israelisyrian peace accord to strike back at damascus for supportin g turkish kurdish insurgents and to make greece iraq and iran more circumspect in their military plans furthermore ankara found the idea of arms purchases from is rael an especially attractive way to circumvent impediments to acquisitions fro m the united states and some european countries simultaneously turkey looked to israel to assist in easing turkish relations with the us congress wh ich had created some of those same impediments7 turkey had been worriedly observing th israelisyrian peace talks first it was concerned that possible redeployment of syrian troops from the vicinity of the golan heights might result in syrian military build up along the turkish border second an agreement between israel and syri might lead to greater syrian control over activities of the lebanese shia hizbollah guerrillas in southern lebanon this turkey feared could prompt the united st ates to remove syria from the us state department list of states supporting terrorism before sy ria ended its support for the kurdistan workers party pkk8 the pkk has waged guerrilla war against turkey since 1984 and the united states is one of turkeys few allies to agree unwaveringly with ankara that the pkk is terrorist organization finally there was some unease

derived from the military accords noted above ankara had become frustrated with damascus and may have wanted to send it strong signal by making it feel surrounded by antagonists the turkish syrian relationship has many irritants preeminently syrias support for the pkk other turkish grievances include syrian use of arab fora in lieu of bilateral negotiations to vent its complaints over euphrates watersharing and pique at syrian maps which continue to depict the turkish province of hatay as part of syria six d ecades after france as the mandatory power in syria ceded what was then alexandretta to turkey turkeys military cooperation with israel so has been justified as an attempt to balance what many turks believed was similar arrangement between syria and greece turkishgreek bilateral relations are extremely troubled10 former greek defense minister yerasimo s arsenis had proposed that greece encircle turkey by concluding military accords with many of rkeys neighbors armenia iran iraq syria and bulgaria arseni s and other defense ministry officials claimed that july 1995 military cooperation agreement gave th greek armed forces access to syrian air and naval bases11 the syrian and greek govern ments subsequen tly have denied that base rights were part of an accord and this report not been otherwise substantiated turkish foreign minister em re gonensay stated on turkish television that syrian officials maintained that such an agreement did not exist12 arsenis lost the defense portfolio after the septembe r 1996 national election his successor akis tsohatzopoulos articulates the policy of encirc lement less dramati cally but he has not abandoned it foreign minister theodhoros pangalos said in israel that greece had not signed military cooperation agreem ent with syria contending that greece cooperated with syria in ma ny areas but not militarily13 nonetheless belief in the existence of an accord and of base rights has enjoyed life of its own among many turks disinclined to trust either syrian or greek denials turkish policymakers may have found added incentive for collabora ting with israel in any remaining or convenient uncertainty about the natu

to various actual and facto arms embargos by the united states14 and by some european governments because of its record of human rights violations policy toward its kurdish population bilateral disputes with greece or the unresolved cyprus issue israel does not take what it views as domestic turkish concerns or these issues into account in its arms sales policy in par ticular purchases from israel may enable turkey to circumvent us conditions such as those requiring balance of forces between turkey and greece or restricting the transfer of specific arms when they might be used in the abuse of human rights ie in the war in the southeast turkish and israeli arms are overwhelmingly am erican and some weapons produced by israels indigenous defense i ndustry appear to be copies of usmanufactured arms these arms might therefore be familiar to the turkish military and require less training moreover israel has made improveme nts to some us weapons purchased over the years development that probably led to the contracts to upgrade turkeys usmanufactured aircraft turkey believes that its access to us arms has been impeded by the us congress because of powerful greek and armenianamerican and prokurdish lobbies it does not face comparable obstacl in israel moreover it hopes that the israeli government and proisrael lobbies will work on its beha lf and counter other ethnic lobbies in congress israeli defe nse minister yitzhak mordechai confirmed that israel is assisting turkey on the american political scene and encouraging jewish organizations to follow this example15 ankara has cultivated proisrael lobbies and vice versa for example the bnai brith antidefamation league feted prime minister mesut ilmaz during his december 1997 visit to washington and yilmaz reciprocated by hosting luncheon in ankara for 65 members of the us conference of presidents of major jewish organizations in march 1998 the december 1997 european union decisi on not to include turkey on list with 11 prospective members led turkey to feel isolated and to place greater value on its other western friends notably the united states and israel the eu move also created antipathy in turkey toward arms deals with european countries known to oppose turkeys eu accession the french national assemblys may 29 1998 recognition of the armenian genocide generated illwill toward france in turkey prompting turkey to suspend talks over 441 million contract for antitank missiles finally turkey views russias decision to sell s300 an tiaircraft missiles to cyprus as contributing to security threat to turkey and turkishcypriots although turkey was the first nato country to buy russian arms it now may be less enthusiastic about that lternative in sum israe li arms do not appear to have the political burdens that beset many of their competitors the accessibility of israels weaponry is ma tched by its willingness to enter joint production arrangements turkey has put high priority on developing its domestic defense industry and coproduction enables it to pursue this goalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98633crs7 16general cevik bir turkeys role in the new world order

by the author in ankara december 1997 finally turkey increasingly has expr essed concern about the potential for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in its neighborhood notably in iraq and iran16 it welcomes the opportunity to collabor ate with the israelis on deterrents such as theater missile defense israel israels motivations to improve relations with turkey are similarly varied but changed somewhat with the government turnover in june 1996 establishing and warming relations with arab and muslim nations had been cornerstone of former israeli foreignprime minister shimon peres vision of new middle east17 peres appreciated turkeys importance in the region and thought that it might serve as bridge to other muslim countries even though turkey is officially secular state by 1996 the israeli government so may have become frustrated with its peace talks with syria and wanted to exert pressure on syria from another perspective it is widely believed that the late israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin would have relinquished most of the golan heights but syrian president hafez asad never made the compromises sought by isr ael that would have led to an agreement additionally israel was troubled by syri as continuing support for the hizbollah guerrillas who operate against israels banese allies in s outhern lebanon and against northern israel as well as its f acilitating the transfer of iranian aid to hizbollah the current israeli prime mini ster benjamin neta nyahu echoes turkeys criticism of syrian support for terrorism ex pressly including both hizbollah and the pkk however netanyahu denigrates th idea of new middle east and does not consider turkey as bridge to other c ountries except geographically to the energy resources and markets of azer baijan and central as ia for him the turkishisraeli tie stands alone with its own intrinsic value he has viewed most governments in the region as hostile unchanging entrenched authoritarian regimes and is skeptical of the possibility of reaching lasting agreements with them18 netanyahu contrastingly refers to turkey as the only other democracy in the region19 israel also is greatly concerned about irans potential to produce weapons of mass destruction turkey borders on iran nd many assume that israeli planes flying in turkish airspace gather intelligence on ir an iraq and syria

consider the possibility of turkey providing israel with intelligence and other noncombat assistance in the event of confrontation21 even though the israeliturkish relationship is not one in which either partner is committed to come to the defense of the other in case of war it enables israel to augment its strategic superiority in the region finally the contracts for military sales have boosted israels defense industry israeli aircraft industry had been in par ticularly bad shape before the f4 and f5 contracts but has been rebuilt largely on the strength of the turkish deals criticism domestic some turkish politicians are wary of appearing too proisrael and traditionally are very sympathetic to the palestinians22 they are troubled by the impasse in israelipalestinian peace talks and by some of israels actions regarding jerusalem and the west bank deputy prime minister bulent ecevit and cabinet members from his democratic left party dsp articulate this view turkish civilian leaders usually visit with palestinian authority officials after they visit israel the military do not23 the intensity of arab criticism of turkis hisraeli relations see below however even prompted the powerful turkish general staff the preeminent advocate of ties with israel to intercede with some arab governments if only to prevent the censure from developing into real constraint for example chief of the general staff general ismail hakki karadayi visited cairo in d ecember 1997 to reassure egyptian president mubarak about the nature of the turkishisraeli relationship there are minority voices of dissent in turkey and israel about the relationship in turkey the small 25000 jewish community is ambivalent most turkish jews are supportive israeli defense minister mordechai was the guest of honor at an enthusiastic community dinner in istanbul during his january 1998 visit to turkey some however are apprehensive about the dangers of raising th eir profile through the

with missiles25 the respected military commentator zeev schiff opined that the relationship has been characterized by recklessness when it comes to public relations he recognized that the tie is of strategic importance but did not want israel to get involved in greekturkish disputes over the aegean sea or in turkeys conflict with the pkk26 some in the israeli foreign ministry reportedly are concerned about the defenseministrys pace of improving ties with rkey and disregard of adverse regional reactions 27 regional turkey not israel has been the predominant target of arab and iranian opposition to the turkishisraeli romance as noted above history has bequeathed some antagonism to arabturkish relations due in part to this legacy reaction in the region to the turkishisraeli relationship has been largely negative the arab and iranian backlash also exhibits acute awareness of how the regional balance of power might be skewed by turkishisraeli military alliance in general turks care little about arab opinion relating to its developing ties with israel with some civilian politicians more concerned than the military proponents of the relationship reactions of some individual governments in the region follow syria reflecting its position as an unstated target of the turkishisraeli collaboration syria has taken the lead in voicing opposition and in marshaling

accepted demirels explanation of the planned turkishisraelius search and rescue exer cise in panarab conclaves or when not in the company of turks however egypt as leader of the arab world has been more disapproving of israeliturkis h relations and sympathetic to the concerns of its arab brother syria foreign minister amr musa has said that the turkishisraeli relationship will have negative consequences on the strategic situation in the region35 jordan jordan has peace treaty with israel and friendly ties with turkey it sent an observer to the israelturkeyus search and rescue exercise in january 1998 but jordanian officials pointedly noted that an invitation from ankara had been accepted in order to withhold cred it from israel which amman considers responsible for the stalemat in the arabisraeli peace process jordan and turkey conducted joint military traini ng exercises in april 1998 highranking jordanian military officer attended the semiannual israeliturkish st rategic talks in may 1998 the extent to which jordan lends its presence to such activities gives the developing israeliturkish relationship broader regional gloss and lends credence to those who say it could be force for regional peace and stability palestinian authority turkey has enjoyed good re lations with the palestinians for long time palestinian official s have stated their lack of opposition to intensified turkishisraeli ties but also have indicated that they would like ankara to use its influence with israel to dvance the peace process turkish civilian politicians who visit israel almost always call on

turkishisraeli ties unlike the arabs greece has focused its displeasure on is rael as much as on turkey foreign minister pangalos initially put it diplomatically noting that he did not want turkey to exploit its military cooperation with israel to create certain impression37 by february 1998 however pangalos was describing the israeliturkish relationship an alliance of wrongdoers that brings us to cold war situation38 he later registered unease that israel would provide turkey with intelligence and technology that could be turned against greece this is the core of greek distress with israeliturkish relations greeces defense minister ak is tsohatzopoulos seems to characterize israels choice of turkey as wrongheaded and urges israel to look toward the european union instead during visit to washington in july 1998 he revealed that he had invited israeli defense minister mordechai to visit athens perhaps to convince him of the regional ra mifications of an alliance with ankara and to change course cyprus cyprus and israel have cordial relations since the israeliturkish accords cypriot officials have made friendly representations to israel concerning israeli violations of

change the re gional context and ve implications for other us policies and in terests the us stat department has devoted considerable time and effort trying to achieve comprehensive arabisraeli peace yet the arabs generally negative view of the turkishisrae li association and how it changes the regional strategic balance could have potentially adverse impact on the peace process israeliturkish relations serve to emphasize their differences from and with arab neighbors rather than common goals washington post editorial suggested that the turkishisraeli connection immeasurably strengthens israels security and could reduce israels perceived need to negotiate settlement with the palestinians and syria40 such result could frustra us mediation efforts furthermore since the end of the persian gulf war the united states has sought to contain the iraqi regime of saddam husayn if turkis hisraeli coope ration seriously motivates syria to reach out to baghdad then continued containment of iraq might be undermined finally if turkishisraeli relations adversely affected the united states ability to influence the israeli government they might have similar effect on washingtons dealings with ankara us policy leve rage with ankara is derived from special usturkish bilatera l relationship and from the extent to which turkey looks to the united states as the remaining superpow er to influence other governments and international institutions on its behalf some us policy priorities are probably lower on israels scale of priorities regarding its relations with turkey thus turkeys alliance with israel might eventu ally lead to diminishing of turkeys deference to us views on issues such as improving greekturkish bilateral relations resolving the cyprus issue corr ecting turkeys human rights record and promoting turkish democratization this is not to say that the united states policies would benefit from turkeys isolation for example the united states has encouraged turkeys relations with the eu ropean union which often reinforces us policy perspectives on issues legislation congress has shown intere st in evolving israeli turkish relations but the israeliturkish tie has

taken41 the dod spokesman appeared to confirm that when he said that formal israeli request to sell the arrow to turkey had been made42 the turks are considering collaborating with the israelis in the development of other antimissile systems as well as purchasing u s patriot missiles the prospect of the latter sale may have been factor in us disapproval of an israeliturkish deal involving the arrow the turks howev er may simply want proven weapon and not one still in trials like arrow us permission also will be required for israel to transfer technology to turkey for copr oduction of the popeye

officials are offering other missiles for sale to greece43 this might offset opposition and maintain the regional balance of power
