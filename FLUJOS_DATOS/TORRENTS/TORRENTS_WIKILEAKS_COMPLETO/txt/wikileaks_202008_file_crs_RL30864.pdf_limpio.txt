specialist in international relations foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30864yugoslavia war crimes tribunal current issues for congress summary the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia established by security council resolutions in 1993 was the first international war crimes court to be founded since the postworl d war ii period it is charged with prosecuting persons responsible for war crimes committed in the former yugoslavia since 1991 to date the yugoslavia tri bunal has publicly indicted over 100 persons for crimes relating to the c onflicts in croatia bosnia and kosovo over 40 persons are currently in proceedings at the hague dozens more are under public or secret indictment and the tribunal s chief prosecutor continues to investigate charges against additional suspects the yugo slavia tribunal is separate from and unaffiliated with the international criminal court established by the rome treaty of 1998 and launched by over 60 countries in april 2002 on june 28 2001 former yugoslav lead er slobodan milosevi c was transferred to the hague the trial for milosevic the only head of state to stand before an international court for war crimes commenced in february 2002 and is expected to last couple of years some of yugoslavia s new democratic lead ers had resisted his extradition but yielded to international pressure on the eve of an international conference on financial assistance to yugoslavia pressure was again applied to belgrade in april 2002 when the united states suspended bilateral financial assistance to serbia because of its limited cooperation with the tribunal beyond milosevics transfer in response belg rade passed new legisl ation to allow the transfer of war crimes suspects to the hague and has called on 23 named indicted suspects to surrender voluntarily or be subject to arrest the lingering presence of persons indict ed and suspected of war crimes has been detrimental to the peace process in bosnia by most assessments the two top remaining indicted suspects former bosn ian serb leaders radovan karadzic and ratko mladic remain at large nato peacekeeping forces in bosnia have seized over twenty alleged war criminals since 1997 however nato efforts to seize karadzic in eastern bosnia in early 2002 were unsuccessful after milosevics fall from power in late 2000 the clinton administration removed economic sanctions against serbia and began to provide economic assistance authorized by congress to serbia however congress mandated deadline of march 31 2001 for belgrade to comply with commitments to c ooperate with the tribunal or face funding cutoff in april the bush administration certified that belgrade was meeting these commitments but continued to pressure belgrade to demonstrate further progress especially th transfer of milosevic which took place in june facing similar deadline the following year the administration held off certification of serbian compliance with the tribunal until ma 21 when it cited recent measures of progress by belgrade and released remaining unobligated us assistance to serbia for fy2002 while it has consistently supported the yugoslavia tribunal over the years the united states is opposed to the establishment of the international criminal cour t and formally renounced the icc treaty in may

2002yugoslavia war crimes tribunal current issues for congress introduction during the course of brutal war in bosniaherzegovina the security council founded an internati onal tribunal in 1993 at the hague the netherlands to bring to justice individuals responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity within the territory of the former yugosl avia since 1991 stating that the tribunal would contribute to the restoration and ma intenance of peace the security council established the court without waiting fo r peaceful settlement to the bosnian conflict the yugoslavia tr ibunal was the first war crime s court to be founded since the nuremberg and tokyo tribunals after world war ii1 the war in bosnia ended in late 1995 with the signing of the dayton peace agreement and the deployment of natoled peacekeeping force to bosnia few years later violent conflict broke out in the serbian province of kosovo leading ultimately to natoled air operation and the establishment of an international protectorate for kosovo in 1999 and s econd natoled peacekeeping force in the balkans though some violence and tensi ons have continued elsewhere such as in macedonia in 2001 relative peace and greater stability have facilitated tribunal activities and investigations into the earlier wars the number of indicted persons put in custody at the hague has gradually but steadily increased to date however dozens indicted publicly or secretly as war criminals remain at large and tribunal prosecutors continue to investigate wa r crimes suspects in some cases local authorities have resisted the transfer of such persons some of whom have held high political or military positions to the hague international forces have detained and transferred several charged with war cr imes but have been unwilling to hunt them down systematically experience of the past several years has shown that pursuit of justice with regard to war crimes is not an abstract exercise but one with direct policy consequences in bosnia persons indicted for war crime s though barred by the international community from holding political office often continue to bear significant political and economic influence promote extremist views or otherwise present obstacles to progress in turn lack of progress in achieving selfsustaining peace reduces the likelihood of withdrawing inte rnational

become evident as yugoslavias successor states have attempted to normalize relations with the international community and integrate into western institutions coopera tion by states of the former yugoslavia with the tribunal s in some cases become precondition to international acceptance and external financial assistance under the milosevic regime the federal republic of yugoslavia s refusal to cooperate at any level with the hague kept the fry from access to international loans and reentry into international organizations under the c ontroversial leadership of franjo tudjman until late 1999 croatia maintained diffi cult relationship with the hague tribunal which limited the depth of its relations with the european union and nato the fate of slobodan milosevic indicted for war crimes has been prominent policy issue since the dramatic end to hi s regime in late 2000 on the one hand international leaders have sought to reward and assist the new democratic governments in serbia and yugoslavia which preferred to see milosevic tried at home for domestic crimes and opposed his extradition on the other hand many consider milosevic to be the single most culpable war criminal nd ultimately responsible for the highest level of war crimes throughout the former yugoslavia full cooperation with the tribunal by belgra assumed to include the transfer of milosevic was precondition to us s upport for internationa l economic assistance to the fry observers differed in their views on how much and how quickly the new democratic regime in the fry should fu lfill its commitments with

some suspects preferring to go before the hague rather than wait for arrest the focus of the tribunals investigati ons and indictments has also shifted by design from lowranking perpetrators to individuals holding the highest military or political command authority and therefore the greatest responsibility for war crimes because of the very large number of suspected lowlevel war criminals subordinates who carried out the orders9 the tribunal has largely left prosecution of these individuals to national or local authorities10 the highest ranking person in custody is former serbian and yugoslav president slobodan milosevic who was transferred in june 2001 his trial commenced in february 2002 even as the prosecutors office continues to prepare indictments for example against ethnic albanians for crimes committed against ethni c serbs in kosovo after june 1999 the tribunal aims to complete all of its current inves tigations by 2004 given its growing caseload the tribunal is also

tribunals most recently publishe d annual report from september 2001 said that the two main difficulties facing the court were the number of accused still at large and the need to find resources to permit the accused to be tried within reasonable amount of time11 the report said that tri bunal activities c ould conclude by 2007 if procedural reforms are impleme nted see section on tribunal procedures below and if further conflict breaks out in the former yugoslavia the bush administration has strongly advocated working toward concluding the tribunals mission within this time

investigate war crimes in kosovo and required belgrade to fully cooperate with its effortscurrent policy issues since the inception of the yugoslavia tribunal the international community has maintained that all those indicted as war criminals should either surrender or be transferred by local police or interna tional forces and brought to the hague cooperation with the tribunal by local au thorities has increased in recent months leading to the transfer of more war crimes suspects to the hague those in favor of bringing all remaining indicted suspects to the hague say that their arrest and transfer would remove the influence of nationalist hardliners from the local political environment throughout the former yugosl avia and thereby ssist nonnationalist forces it might promote peace imple mentation efforts and facilitate some reconciliation among the former warring communities on the other hand attempts by international forces to hunt down accused war criminals may lead to greater casualties loyalists to highranking persons charged with war crimes might try to undermine reformist governments or instig ate renewed violence an influx of several more indicted persons at

factor impeding norma lized relations between yugoslavia and the west for years the international community conditioned the lifting of an outer wall of sanctions which prevented fry membership in international organizations and withheld access to multilateral aid on belgrades mee ting international obligations to cooperate w ith the tribunal under milosevic the fry remained intransigent and obstructionist with re gard to tribunal activities milosevic frequently denounced the tribunal as antise rb and nato tool tribunal officials repeatedly reported on the frys disregar d for its

power in october 2000 the international commun ity quickly embraced the new yugoslav government under president vojislav kost unica in the hopes of consolidating democratic transformation of serbia belg rades prior contenti ous relationship with the hague tribunal was long held up as key factor justifying rbias international isolation the kostunica government expre ssed interest in impr oving relations with the tribunal but resisted demands that it extradite milosevic western governments appeared at least at first to be granting the new yugoslav leadership some leeway in their demands for

secured decisi ve victory in the serbian parliamentary elections on december 23 and zoran djindjic of th dos became serbian prime minister the new yugoslav and serbian govern ments expressed keen interest in addressing the crimes of the milosevic regime but with focus on crimes relating to corruption misuse of public funds electoral fraud po litical assassinations and other domestic misdeeds they argued that milosevic should be held accountable for these crimes before domestic legal institutions the ruling dos was split on whether milosevic should eventually be transferred to the hague with kostunica perhaps the most opposed to extradition and the most cr itical of the tribunal which he claimed had an antiserb bias former fry prime minister zoran zizic of the montenegrin socialist peoples party previously allied with milosevics party also strongly opposed extrad ition in contrast the serbian government under prime minister djindjic was more amenable to the idea of milosevics extradition serbian officials promoting economic reforms warned that foreign assistance necessary for economic reforms would be jeopardized unless th fry accepted full cooperation with the tribunal13 yugoslav and serbian officials pointed to two impediments to milosevics extradition first they said that the yugoslav constitution did not permit the extradition of yugoslav citizen to fo reign court second yugoslav authorities argued that extraditing milosevic before he faced criminal charges at home would only make martyr of the former leader they also said that the transfer of milosevic would be destabilizing to the new yugoslav and serbian governments some observers speculated that the dos sought to maintain good relati ons with milosevic era holdovers in the army and police many of whom assisted the dos in overthrowing milosevic but who are th emselves likely suspects for war crimes the patience of the international community meanwhile began to wear thin in early 2001 in january the yugoslav au thorities placed milosevic under house arrest and established 24hour police surveillance on his residence on april 1 milosevic surrendered to serbian police after tens two day standoff between milosevics armed guards and the police milosevic pleaded not guilty to charges of financial crimes misuse of power and re sisting arrest tribunal fficials viewed milosevics arrest as positive

prosecutor on the status of the draft law on cooperation with the tribunal and pledged to take measures to expel non fry citizens indicted for war crimes from serbia on march 23 yugoslav authorities arrested milomir stakic former bosnian serb mayor of prijedor and wanted under secret indictment for war crimes and transferred him to the hague fry president kostunica sharply criticized the arrest and called it an exception in contrast tribunal prosecutor l ponte called it the first concrete example of cooperation by belgrade after milosevics april 1 rrest belgrade took additi onal steps relating to war crimes issues in april the yugoslav military prosecutor announced that nearly 200 yugoslav army officers had been char ged with war crimes committed in kosovo in may the serbian government publicized the exhumations of several mass grave sites in serbia holding kosovo albanian victims that had been transferred from kosovo with extensive serbian media c overage the mass graves for the first time provided irrefutable evidence of war crimes to the serbian people additional mass grave sites in serbia have since been discovered with as many as 1000 bodies unearthed thus far the main focus of the governments agenda with regard to war crimes issues was draft legislation on coope ration with the tribunal wh ich the government argued was necessary to allow for the extradition of milosevic or any other indicted suspect in yugoslavia fry president kostunica came out in favor of the draft law although he made co mmitmen ts on milosevics eventual extraditi on tribunal officials supported passage of the law but emphasized that the actual transfer of suspects to the hague was what was required the dr aft law stalled in parliament however when the montenegrin socialist peoples
