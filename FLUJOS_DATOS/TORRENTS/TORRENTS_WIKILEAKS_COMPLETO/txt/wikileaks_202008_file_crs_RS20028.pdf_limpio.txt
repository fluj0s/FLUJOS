devel opment act pl 102580 504510 background the nature of marine pollution requires that it be regulated internationally since once pollutant enters marine wa ters it knows boundary thus series of regional treaties and conventions pertaining to local marine pollution problems and more comprehensive international conventions providing uniform standards to control worldwide marine pollution has evolved over the last 35 years at the same time that key in ternational protocol s were being adopt ed and ratified by large number of countries worl dwide in the early 1970s th united states enacted the mprsa to regulate disposal of wastes in marine waters that are within us jurisdiction it utilizes comprehensive and uniform waste management system to regulate disposal or dumping of all materials in to ocean waters prior to 1972 us marine waters had been used extensively as convenient alternative to landbased sites for th disposal of various wastes such as sewage sludge industrial wastes and pipeline discharges and runoff the basic provisions of the act have re mained virtually unchanged since 1972 but many new authorities have been added these newer parts include 1 research responsibilities for the environm ental protection agency epa 2 specific direction that epa phase out the disposal of harmful sewage sludges and industrial wastes 3 ban on the ocean dis posal of sewage sludge and i ndustrial wastes by december 31 1991 4 inclusion of long island sound within the purview of the act and 5 inclusion of medical waste provisions authorizations for appropriations to support provisions of the law expired at the end of fy1997 sep tember 30 1997 authorities did not lapse however and congress has c ontinued to appropriate f unds to carry out the act four federal agencies have responsibilities under the ocean dumping act epa the us army corps of engineers the national oceanic and atmospheric administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20028crs3 1 see httpwwwepagovowowoceansregulatorydumpdredgedannualreporthtml 2 see httpelerdcusacearmymilodddefaulthtmnoaa and the coast guard epa has primary authority for regulating ocean disposal of all substances except dredged spoils wh ich are under the authority of the corps of engineers noaa is responsible for longrang research on the eff ects of humaninduced changes to the marine environment while epa is authorized to carry out research and demonstration activities related to phasing out sewage sludge and industrial waste dumping the coast guard is charged with maintaining surveillance of ocean dumping regulating ocean dumping title i of the mprsa prohibits all ocean dumping except that allowed by permits in any ocean waters under us jurisdiction by any us vessel or by any vessel sailing from us port certain materials such as highlevel radioactive waste chemical and biological warfare agents dical waste sewage sludge and industrial waste may not be dumped in the ocean permits for dumping of other materials except dredge spoils can be issued by the epa after notice nd opportunity for public hearings where the administrator determines that such dumpi ng will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health welfare the marine environment ecological systems or economic potentialities the law regulates ocean dumpi ng within the area extending 12 nautical miles seaward from the us baseline and regulates transport of material by usflagged vessels for dumping into ocean waters epa designates sites for ocean dumping and specifies in each permit where the material is to be disposed epa prepares an nnual report of ocean dumping permits for ma terial other than dredged material1 in 1977 congress amended the act to requi re that dumping of municipal sewage sludge or industrial wastes that unreasonabl degrade the environment cease by december 1981 however that deadline was not ach ieved and amendmen ts passed in 1988 extended the deadline to december 1991 in 1986 congress directed that ocean disposal of all wastes cease at the traditional 12mile s ite off the new yorknew jersey coast that is it barred issuance of permits at the 12mile site and directed that disposal be moved to new site 106 miles offshore in 1988 c ongress enacted several laws amending the ocean dumping act with particular em phasis on phasing out sewage sludge and industrial waste disposal in the ocean which continued despite earlie r legislative efforts in 1992 congress amended the act to permit states to adopt ocean dumping standards more stringent than federal standards and to require that permits conform with longterm management plans for designated dumpsites to ensure that permitted activities are consistent with expected uses of the site virtually all ocean dumping that occurs today is dredged material sediments removed from the bottom of waterbodies in or der to maintain navi gation channels and berthing areas other materials that are dum ped include vessels fish wastes and human remains the corps of engineers issues pe rmits for ocean dumping of dredged material the bulk of which results from maintenance dred ging by the corps itself or its contractors according to data compiled by the corps each year an average of 70 million cubic yards of dredged sediment material is disposed of in the ocean at designated sites2 beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20028crs4 sediments can be permitte d to be dumped in the ocean they are evaluated to ensure that the dumping will not cause significant harmful effects to human health or the marine environment epa is responsible for developi ng criteria to ensure that the ocean disposal of dredge spoils does not cause environmen tal harm permits for ocean disposal of dredged material are to be based on the same criteria utilized by epa under other provisions of the act and to the extent possible eparecommended dumping sites are used where the only feasible disposition of dredged material w ould violate the dumping criteria the corps can request an epa wa iver amendments enacted in 1992 expanded epas role in permitting of dredged materi by authorizing epa to impose permit conditions or even deny permit if n ecessary to prevent environmental harm permits issued under the ocean dumping ac t specify the type of material to be disposed the amount to be transported fo r dumping the location of the dumpsite the length of time the permit is valid and special provisions for surveillance the epa administrator can require permit applicant to provide information necessary for the review and evaluation of the application enforcement the act authorizes epa to assess civ il penalties of not more than 50000 for each violation of permit or permit requirement taki ng into account such factors as gravity of the violation prior violations and demonstr ations of good faith however penalty can be assessed until after notice nd opportunity for hearing criminal penalties including seizure and forfeiture of vessels for knowing vi olations of the act also are authorized in addition the act authorizes penalties fo r ocean dumping of medical wastes civil penalties up to 125000 for each violation nd criminal penalties up to 250000 five years in prison or both the coast guard is directed to conduct surveillance and other appropriate enforcement activities to preven t unlawful transportation of material for dumping or unlawful dumping like many other federal environmental laws the ocean dumping act allows individuals to bring citizen suit in us district court against any person including the united states for vi olation of permit or other prohibition limitation or criterion issued under title i of the act in conjunction with the ocean dumping act the clean water act cwa regulates all discharges into navigable waters including the territorial seas although these two laws overlap in their coverage of dumping from vessels within the territorial seas any question of conflict is essentially moot b ecause epa has promulgated uniform set of standards 40 cfr parts 220229 the ocean dumping act preempts the cwa in coastal waters or open oceans and the cwa c ontrols in estuaries states are permitted to regulate ocean dumping in waters within their jurisdiction under certain circumstances the ocean dumping act also requires the administrator to the extent possible to apply the standards and criteria binding upon th united states that are stated in the 1972 convention on the prevention of marine po llution by dumping of wastes and other matters known as the london dumping conven tion this convention signed by more than 85 countries includes annexes that pr ohibit the dumping of mercury cadmium and other substances such as ddt and pcbs solid wastes and persistent plastics oil high level radioactive wastes and chemical and biological warfare agents and requires special permits for other heavy metals cyanides and fluorides and medium and lowlevel radioactive wasteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20028crs5 research and coastal wa ter quality monitoring title ii of the mprsa authorizes two type s of research general research on ocean resources under the jurisdiction of noaa and epa research related to phasing out ocean disposal activities noaa is directed to carry out comprehens ive longterm research program on the effects not only of ocean dumping but so of pollution overfishing and other humaninduced changes on the marine ecosystem additionally noaa assesses damages from spills of petrol eum and petroleum products epas research role includes research investigations expe riments training demonstrations surveys and studies to minimize or end the dumping of sewage sludge and industrial wastes along with research on alternatives to ocean disposal amendments in 1980 required epa to study technological options for removing heavy metals and certain organic materials from new york citys sewage sludge title iv of the mprsa established nine regional marine research boards for the purpose of developing comprehensive marine research plans considering water quality and ecosystem conditions and research and monitoring priorities and objectives in each region the plans after approval by noaa and epa are to guide noaa in awarding research grant funds under this title of the act title v of the mprsa established national coastal water quality monitoring program it directs epa and noaa jointly to implement longterm program to collect and analyze scientific data on the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems including ambient water quality health and quality of living resources sources of environmental degradation and data on tre nds results of these activ ities including intensive monitoring of key coastal waters are intende d to provide information necessary to design and implement effective pr ograms under the clean water act and coastal zone management act table 2 major us
