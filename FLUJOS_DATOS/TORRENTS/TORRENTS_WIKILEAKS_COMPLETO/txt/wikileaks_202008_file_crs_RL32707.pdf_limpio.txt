the national airspace system factors aﬀecting the ability to expand airport and airspace capacity to meet future demands and the impact of capacity constraints on ﬂight operations and aviation safety this report also examines several possible strategies to expand system capacity many of which are being implemented or evaluated by the faa and congress these strategies fall into four broad categories 1 airport expansion and infrastructure improvements 2 technology options to improve traﬃc ﬂow and safely reduce aircraft separation 3 strategic plans and tactical tools to improve traﬃc ﬂow and respond to delayinducing events and 4 market based solutions to alter the demand characteristics of ﬂight operations at busy airports and in congested airspace finally this report examines the

bart elias specialist in aviation safety security and technology resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707avoiding gridlock in the skies issues and options for addressing growth in air traffic summary major challenge facing aviation policym akers is developing strategy for increasing the capacity of the national airspace system to keep pace with projected growth in demand for air travel while transportation secretary norman minetas vision for the next generation air traffic system aspires to triple system capacity by 2025 faa projections suggest that capacity enhancements will struggle to keep pace with growth in demand at major airpor ts in busy airspace around major metropolitan areas and along certain busy high altitude corridors factors including the continuing population shift into major tropolitan areas the increased reliance on smaller jets in both airline and general aviation operations and increased pointto point service are expected to spur growth in those aviation operations that impact high altitude airspace and contribute to in creased congestion at capacity constrained airports the current aviation system is constrained by limited available capacity at critical major metropolitan airports and is increasingly unable to meet projected future demand the system also is constrained by outdated technology and procedures that limit the utilization of ava ilable airspace in addition to meeting these challenges the faa also faces intern challenges to meet future controller staffing needs given that almost half of its existing controller workforce is expected to retire over the next decade the f aa also faces significant challenges in reforming its organizational culture which hi storically has been blamed for consistent cost overruns schedule slips and perform ance shortfalls in major air traffic modernization projects two new organizations within the faa the air traffic organization ato and the joint planning and developmen t office jpdo are viewed as key elements of organizational reform that ma be closely scrutinized by congress and administration policymakers to ensure that they effectively manage the implementation of near term and long range capacity enhancement efforts the key challenges for these organizations is to develop and execute capacity expansion plans that appropriately inve st in airport infrastructure ai r traffic system technology and operational procedures to keep pace with expected growth in demand for air travel while maintaining or improving upon curr ent levels of safety and efficiency possible strategies for meeting these objectives include implementing free flight concepts that will allow more autonomy nd direct routing of aircraft to better optimize airsp ace ut ilization safely reducing aircraft separation standards to increase capacity in crowded airspace effectively implementing automation and decision aiding technologies to improve airspace utilization and traffi c flow and expanding and reconfiguring existing ai rport infrastructure in addition dema nd management strategies such as curtailing peak hour f lights or implementing slots or quotas may be examined as means to align demand with available capacity at congested airports the faas investment strategy for meeting these capacity needs is also likely to be of considerable interest in future years as significant funding challenges may arise because of possible aviation trust fund shor tages and history of significant cost overruns on major airspace modernization pr

addressing growth in air traffic the demand for air travel over the next 15 years is expected to grow significantly necessitating the expansion of the national airspace system passenger boardings are expected to increase by almost 60 compared to preseptember 11 2001 levels1 systemwide air traffic operations are expected to increase by about 15 including 30 growth in air tran sport and commercial operations at the nations 35 busiest airports total operations are expected to increase more than 34 by 2020 to expand system capacity to meet this projected growth the department of transportation s unveiled an ambitious plan ca lling for threefold increase in systemwide capacity over the next 15 to 20 years however at least in the nearterm planned capacity enhancement projects are expected to lag slightly behind projected growth in aviation operations therefore to meet future demand novel approaches may be needed to expand system capacity while maintaining system efficiency and safety speaking before the aero club of washington in january 2004 secretary of transportation norman mine ta unveiled his plan for th future of the national airspace system and set the bar for expanding its capacity unless we act now our leadership in avia tion and aerospace is in jeopardy and we could be facing gridlock in our national airspace therefore i have launched an initiative to galvanize americas energies to design the next generation air transportation system cleaner quieter system based on 21st century technology that will offer seamle ss security and added capacity to relieve congestion and secure americas place as global leader in aviations second century we will harness technology in way that triples the capacity of our aviation system over the next 15 to 20 years2 experts have expressed concerns that unless the faa addresses the impact of anticipated growth in air traffic flight operations are likely to be constrained by undercapacity in the national airspace syst em especially at the nations busiest airports while clearly significant increase in capacity is likely to be needed tripling system capacity as secretary minetas vision aspires to do appears to be an extremely lofty goal to attain nonetheless additional capacity is especially needed at several of the nations busiest airports that are already operating at orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs2

slightly above their theoretical capacity limits during peak travel times and in poor weather scenarios3 in fact if capacity could be doubled ove r the next 20 years these enhancements will likely be sufficient to provide nough headroom to accommodate projected growth in aviation operations for about th next 30 years however many remain skeptical whether even this goal is achievable and worry that unless significant changes occur the national ai rspace system is destined to be constrained by under capacity at the nations busiest airports and an inability to expand the infrastructure and effectively implement t echnology and procedural changes to air traffic operations to alleviate congestion and delay these critics point to faas historic failures to effectively manage major acquisition projects large looming costs for air traffic operations and capacity enhancem ent projects and possible shortfalls in the aviation trust fund as major hurdles standing in th way of progress to fully implement the next generation air trans portation system ngats several challenges have been identified that may limit the faas ability to significantly increase the capacity of the national airspace system over the next 15 to 20 years one significant challenge is overcoming faas traditional organizational culture that has in the opinion of many failed to eff ectively develop comprehensive national strategy for enhancing capacity and failed to effectively manage major acquisition efforts signed to address capacity needs4 second factor is that there is relatively high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with many of the proposed programs designed to enhance capacity while some of that risk can be tied to faas past perform ance in managing airspace modernization projects it should also be recognized that the complexity of the technology and the national airspace system pose significant technical challenges that expose both short term and longrange plans for enhancing av iation capacity to considerable risk third factor is the potential lack of ava ilable capital to fund cap acityrelated projects and programs possible revenue shortfalls in the airpor t and airways trust fund and potential cuts to the faa s facilities and equipment account could significantly impede progress toward enhancing capacity if these current funding challenges persist faa is likely to face difficult d ecisions in prioritizing capacity enhancing projects over the next several years this report examines factors influencing the forecast growth and changing characteristics of flight operations in the national airspace system factors affecting the ability to expand airport and airspace cap acity to meet future demands and the impact of capacity constraints on flight ope rations and aviation sa fety this report also examines several possible strategies to expand system capacity many of which are being implemented or evaluated by the faa and congress these strategies fall into four broad categories 1 airport ex pansion and infrastruct ure improvements 2 technology options to improve traffic flow and safely reduce airc raft separation 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs3 5 crs calculations of correlation between omb historical data of gdp and faa terminal area forecast taf historical data of system wide enplanements and operations correlation values measure how closely related two variab are and range between 1 and 1 since the correlations between gdp and passenger boa rdings and gdp and flight operations are close to 1 these variables are considered to be closely related however this does not imply that there is any causal relationship between these variablesstrategic plans and tactical tools to imp rove traffic flow and respond to delay inducing events and 4 market based solu tions to alter the mand characteristics of flight operations at busy airports and in congested airspace finally this report examines the fiscal needs and funding cha llenges associated with implementing both nearterm and longterm programs to improve aviation system capacity factors affecting growth in air traffic operations several factors are expected to affect the growth in air traffic operations over the next several years behind all of thes factors is the countrys overall economic growth another key underlying factor is the growth in us population and more importantly the population shift into major metropolitan areas and corresponding economic growth in these areas additional factors include the increased use of smaller commuter jets more pointtopoint routes for airline service and significant growth in business jet operations the net result of these factors is forecast average annual growth rate of about 44 in airborne hours for airlines including all cargo carriers commuter operators and business jets these operations will most significantly impact the busiest commercial and general aviation reliever airports in the united states airspace in major metr opolitan areas and certain busy high altitude corridors impact of overall economic growth on aviation future demand for aviation is likely to cl osely track projected growth in gross domestic product gdp in fact proj ected gdp growth is the main factor considered in faas forecast assumptions for aviation demand over the next 10 years and has historically been an excellent longterm predictor of growth in the aviation industry analysis of historic data from 1976 to 2003 indicate that the correlation between gdp and passenger boardings is 097 and the correlation between gdp and the total number of air carrier air taxi and other commercial operations is 0945 over the past few years however this s not been the case the response to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks declin in air travel during the initial phase of the us war with iraq and impact from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak have all been iden tified as contributors to the significant decline in aviation operations over the past four years that could not have been foreseen in fact when the years between 2001 and 2003 are removed from the analysis the correlation between gdp and passenger boardings rises to almost 099 and the correlation between gdp and commerc ial operations is almost 097 as the aviation industry recovers from these unpr ecedented events passenger demand and operations are expected to resume track of growth that closely parallels the forecast rise in gdp barring any unforeseen events that could significantly alter this projected growth patternhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs4 6 frank hobbs and nicole stoops demographic trends in the 20th century census 2000 special reports us

aviation solutions new haven ctwhile the faa expects that other economic factors such as the consumer price index cpi and fuel costs will have negligible impact on forecast growth in aviation operations over the next 10 years anticipated changes in the shape of the aviation industry may raise the significan ce of these factors in predicting future demand for aviation operations for exampl rising fuel costs to the aviation industry could drive up airline ticket prices thus slowing demand for air travel such factors are likely to become more important considerations as the aviation industry shifts toward consumer base consisting of more leisure travelers whose purchasing patterns tend to be more co st sensitive comp etition among lowcost carriers in market of cost conscious consumers with ready access to ticket pricing data over the internet is likely to keep airline prices relatively low and demand high the emergence of other aviation options for business consumers such as fractional ownership programs for business jets and lower cost minijets may result in further shift the demand characteristics for airline travel and alter the composition of operations in the national airspace system population growth in metropolitan areas since the end of world war ii major metropolitan areas have grown significantly see figure 1 by 2000 more than 80 of us residents were living in metropolitan areas fifty of these tropolitan areas had populations greater than 1 million people and these areas were home to 57 of the total us population6 the resulting impact of the increasing population concentra tion in metropolitan areas on aviation is reflected by high nsity of air traffic operations and concerns over capacity at relatively small number of commercial and general aviation reliever airports located within these major metropolitan areas in fact out of more than 400 airports with commercial servi ce in the united states the faa currently identifies only 35 commercial airports in its nearterm strategic plan for enhancing the capacity of the national airspace system the operational evolution plan oep7 all of the airports listed in the oep ar located in major metropolitan regions with more than one and onehalf million inhabitants these 35 airports referred to as the oep35 airports handled 57 of all co mmercial operations at towered airports between fy1999 and fy2002 while capacity constraints delays and environmental considerations are likely to be the most significant issues for these large metropolitan airports the continued availability and adequacy of service is likely to be challenge for airports outside of these major population centers many of which have already lost ai r service as result of airline industry cutbacks8 in other words while major metropolitan areas are likely to face challenges in meeting aviati on capacity needs airports in small citieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs5 9 federal aviation administrati on and the

influence of both population and income gr owth in major metropolitan areas on air traffic demand characteristics the faa and the mitre corporations center for advanced aviation system development cassd recently released detailed study of aviation capacity needs over the next 15 years9 the study identified five airports acr oss the country where additional capacity is already needed hartsfieldjackson atlanta international atl newark liberty international ewr new york laguar dia lga chicago ohare ord and philadelphia international phl atlanta georgia was identified as the one metropolitan area already in need of add itional capacity because it lacks second commercial airport to offloa d some of the atl traffic however the study found that the completion of fifth runway at atl should meet atlantas additional capacity needs at least until 2020 the study concluded that by 2013 15 ai rports will need additional capacity improvements assuming pla nned enhancements at air ports are completed before then all three major airports in the new york metropolitan area ewr lga and kennedy international jfk made the list as did three airports in the angeleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs6 area if planned improvements dont occur the total number of airports needing additional capacity may rise as high as 26 according to the study by 2020 the number of airports needing additional capacity will grow to 18 assuming planned enhancements stay on track before then an additional 23 airports were identified as potentially needing additional capacity by 2020 if planned improveme nts are delayed or cancelle d for some metropolitan areas the outlook is not particularly pro mising in angeles for example if planned enhancements dont occur additiona l capacity will be n eeded at all major commercial airports and two key relieve r airports even with the planned enhancements in place the angele s metropolitan area w ill face significant capacity constraints in the next 10 to 15 years while major metropolitan areas like an geles and new york face significant challenges to meet aviation capacity needs over the next 15 years capacity needs are not limited to the largest metropolitan areas and the current busiest airports for example the study found that the fastgro wing metropolitan areas of austin and san antonio texas and tucson arizona while not included in the oep35 are anticipated to have significant need for additional capacity over the next 15 years spurred by large economic growth in sum the capacity needs study identifies significant challenges ahead for meeting aviation capacity demand in large and fast growing metropolitan areas increased use of smaller jets besides population growth in metropolita n areas the shift toward using more smaller jets in scheduled service and expansion of the business jet market is expected to increase the operational load of the national airspace system many are anticipating the arrival of airbus a380 the worlds largest commercial airliner which is expected to enter service in 2006 however the a380 is targeted at longrange international operations and is expected to have negligible impact on airspace capacity considerations domestically especially since domestic passenger airline has placed an order for even one of these airplanes to date in fact the projected trend in the domestic us market is actually toward smaller jets rather than larger jets both in the airline industr and also in charter and general aviation operations the net effect of large anticipated growth in the market and utilization of these smaller aircraft is an expected increase in traffic at both commercial and general aviation reliever airports regional jets regional and commuter airlines have been and continue to convert their fleets from turboprop aircraft to faster regional jets that appeal to consumer demand for jet service regi onal jet manufacturers chiefly canadian maker bombardier and braz ilian manufacturer embraer c ontinue to produce large numbers of aircraft for the 50 to 90 seat regional market nd are now developing larger aircraft that will seat up to 120 pa ssengers to compete with the boeing 717 and airbus a319 faa data indicate that the number of regional jets flown by regional and commuter carriers has increased by about 550 since 1 998 the gr owth in regional jets is expected to continue but at reduced rate the number of regional jets is expected to double compared to cu rrent fleet size by 2015 this increase inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs7 10 eric torbenson smaller jets lift prof its but have airlines overindulged the dallas morning news june 5 2004regional jets will only be slightly offset by modest decline in the use of turboprop aircraft overall net increase in regional and commuter fleet size of 50 over current levels is forecast see figure 2 source faa aerospace forecasts fy20052016 while the size of the overall regional and commuter fleet including turboprop and turbojet aircraft is anticipated to increase by 50 over the next 10 years the utilization of these aircraft is expected to increase by 60 over that same time period indicating an increased reliance on these smaller airplanes like fleet size utilization of commuter and regional jets is expected to increase more than twofold by 2015 see figure 3 however skeptical industry experts have questioned th optimistic growth projections for regional jets these an alysts point out that along highly competitive routes with competition from lowcost carriers operating small jets is more costly than operating larger jets simply because there are fewer revenue generating seats to offset the fixed unit ope rating costs they reason that if cost schedule and other factors ar relatively equal consumers would rather travel on the larger jets anyway skeptical analysts also caution that airlines have overbought regional jets in the 50 passenger seat size ra nge and there may soon be glut of these 50seat aircraft on the used aircraft market10 regional jets play critical role in serving smaller markets their future therefore depends to large extent on air lines finding ways to make profit serving these markets since the regional jets have historically been run by network affiliates figure 2 fleet composition for regional and commuter operators passenger aircraft 30 passenger seatshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs8 of major legacy air carriers many of w hom are now financially troubled the once certain prospects of continued growth in the regional jet market reflected in the faa forecasts is now much more doubtful what there is greater certainty about however is the forecast growth in passenger volume that is driving these trends how regional jets fit into the airlines strategic plans to meet this demand is much less certain perhaps they will grow as forecast or perhaps they will be replaced by large passenger jets in many markets if regional jet operations do grow as forecast they are likely to have very large impact on system capacity especially at busy hub airports source faa aerospace forecasts fy20052016 business jets and minijets while negligible growth is expected in operations of pistonengine and turboprop aircraft used for general aviation and air taxi operations over the next 10 years sign ificant growth in business jets and very small jet aircraft referred to by many as minijets is anticipated by some whether this trend plays out as some anticipate will largely depend on the overall health of the us economy as the business jet marketplace has historically been very sensitive to economic conditions from an air traffi c management standpoint this projected trend will likely have large impact th operations will likely place significant demands on high altitude airspace c ongested airspace around major metropolitan areas and particularly at general aviati on reliever airports and those commercial airports that have fair amount of general aviation opera tions in addition to commercial traffic two specific trends are likely to spur continued growth in the business jet market these trends are the proliferati on of fractional owners hip programs and the introduction of relatively low cost minijets both of these trends are viewed as figure 3 fleet utilization for regional and commuter operators passenger aircrafthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs9 11 national business aircraft association nbaa business aviation fact book 2004 washington dcopening up the aviation marketplace to many customers who previously viewed aircraft ownership as cost prohibitive the increased flexibility in trip scheduling and available airports that business jets can ope rate in and out of coupled with the ability to avoid many of the hassles of airline trav such as parking ticketing and security screening is likely to prompt business travelers and corporations to consider fractional ownership programs and minijets as alternatives to airline travel fractional ownership one specific source of the large growth in business jet operations is the exponentia l growth in fractionally owne d aircraft in fractional ownership arrangements corporations or individuals purchase an interest in as little as 116th of an airplane or 132nd of he licopter and typically pay fixed fee for operations and maintenance large fracti onal ownership manage ment companies like netjets and bombardier flexjet provide fractional owners with access to all comparable and smaller sized aircraft in their fleet thus providing owners with on demand access to entire fleet of business jets at small fraction of the typical purchase and operating cost of just one ai rplane in essence this arrangement provides the fractional owner with fixed number of hours of flight time usage in jet of particular size each year more recent innovative approaches such as the marquis jet card program ffered by netjets allow bus inesses and individuals to purchase flight time in 25hour increments thus providing access to business jets at an even lower cost than buying into fractional ownership program fractional ownership programs and charter flighttime purchase programs like the marquis jet card are likely to attract significant number of corporations and individuals to business aircraft operations who would have otherwise viewed the costs of owning and operating business airc raft to be prohibitive the fractional ownership concept although first introdu ced in the mid 1980s was still virtually unheard of 10 years ago however over th past 10 years fractional ownership programs have seen exponential growth see figure 4 i n t h l s t f u r r s fractional ownership has grown by 62 this trend is expected to continue experts believe that only small amount of the potential for fractional ownership has been developed so far and forecasts estimate that the number of fractional shares will reach 7000 and the total number of fracti onal aircraft will be about 1200 by 2007 fractional ownership is expected to account for about 100 aircraft deliveries per year through 2012 by then fractional aircraft ar expected to comprise almost 14th of the business aircraft market11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs10 12 adam aircraft industries inc adam aircraft

trend that is likely to attract new customers to the business jet marketplace in the near future is the anticipated entry of several lowcost very light jets vljs with typical seatin g configurations for 56 passengers the vljs currently under development will have cruise airspeed capabilities of about 400 miles per hour and will fly along high ltitude routes above 18000 feet along with airliners and larger business jets first generation minijets such as the eclipse 500 jet and adam aircraft a700 adamjet are expected to enter full scale production in 2007 and will sell in the 115 million price rang not to be outdone by these new entrants established business jet manufacturers like ce ssna and raytheon beechcraft are now offering small entrylevel jets as well these aircraft may not be limited to just private or business use for example donald burr founder of people express and robert crandall former ceo of american airlines have teamed to form startup air taxi corporation and placed 75 aircraft order for the a700 adamjet12 the minijet concept is too new to foresee whether they will attract sizable market for air taxi operations historically air taxi operations using small aircra ft have met with only limite d success anywhere besides alaska hawaii and in some western states because of consumer reluctance to fly on small airplanes the ultimate success of ventures such as these will likely depend onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs11 the ability to establish we ll proven safety record for these small jets success is also likely to depend heavily on identifying and exploiting niche markets where such service can provide cost effective altern ative to other modes of transportation while the overall impact of newly introduced and forthcoming minijets remains largely unknown the market for minijets particularly from fr actional ownership programs and private owners appears pro mising for manufacturers with so many companies vying for stake in the minijet market clearly there are great expectations of high dema nd for these airplanes the net effect of these trends the pr oliferation of minijets and fractionally owned business jets will likely be significant increase in general aviation and air taxi jet operations this is important because these operations unlike typical general aviation operations using smaller pistonengine airplanes will impact high altitude airspace and airspace around major metropolitan areas to much greater extent by 2015 the fleet size for general aviation and ai r taxi jets is expected to double and the total usage of these aircraft expressed in terms of hours flown is expected to increase by 80 see figure 5 this growth is significant because general aviation and air taxi operations sector that is not nearly as visible as the airlines to most observers is expected to maintain about 20 of the share of those flight operations that impact congested airspace source faa aerospace forecasts fy20052016

consequently several low cost carriers have been able to maintain profitability in the weak post september 11 2001 market for air travel wh ereas legacy carriers have collectively lost billions of dollars in response to the growth of lowcost ca rriers several major carriers have launched spinoff operations that mimic the business model of lowcost carriers examples include deltas song and united airlines ted presently with four legacy airlines in bankruptcy and escalating fuel prices lowcost business models and practices ve been adopted by many as means of controlling costs however adopting low cost carrier model is not by any means guarantee of success as demonstrated by the recent demise of independence air former regional partner of united airlines that struggled in its short history as lowcost competitor and closed its doors in early january 2006 also while united is forging ahead with its subsidiary ted as part of deltas restructuring the song brand is being eliminated and song airplanes are being reintegrated with deltas mainline fleet over the past five years the industry has been very dynamic which likely created some oversupply of flights in the market placing additional strain on capacity many industry expert s believe that this situati on is unsustainable and that ultimately marketplace with fewer carriers and higher load factors filled seats on flights will prevail sharp increase in fuel prices during 2005 has prompted airlines to restructure schedules to increas load factors as much as possible while such factors may reduce congestion somewhat in the short term this may be offset by the lowcost carrier model which relie s more heavily on pointtopoint service this may result in an increased concentration of flights on very specific routes such as between northeast cities and florida stinations as compared to the huband spoke model used by legacy carriers whic h on the other hand tends to concentrate operations at specific hub air ports like atlanta and denverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs13 increased pointtop oint service the hub and spoke system offers extensiv flexibility in routing and centralizes operations in manner that can limit the impact of maintenance and operations related delays and can cellations at airlines hub fac ilities however the hub and spoke system is susceptible to weathe rrelated delays and cancellations due to thunderstorms heavy snow or other extr eme weather conditions at hub locations on the other hand pointtopoint service favored by many of the lowcost carriers is less susceptible to having weatherrela ted delays impact large portions of their operations however this type of operation is more susceptible to maintenance or operationsrelated delays because their netw ork is more decentralized and therefore the availability of maintenance nd operations support is more limited there is little doubt that in order to survive airlines will increasingly adopt lowcost strategies to control costs and main tain or achieve profitability what is less certain is to what degree will low cost airline operations continue to rely on pointto point operations and if and to what extent will growing lowcost carriers evolve their operations into hubands poke model given that there are advantages and disadvantages to both opera tional models hybrid mode ls that incorporate best business practices of each are likely to emerge to some degree legacy carriers are already implementing hybrid operational models as means to reduce costs for example american airlines has implemented what they call rollinghub or hub depeakin g strategy in which they have reduced the number of connecting flights through their main hubs such as dallasforth worth tx dfw the strategy results in longer waits for connecting flights on average while this strategy reduces operating costs by reducing the number of flights because of the longer layovers it may be less appealing to consumers especially in markets where alternative pointtopoint service is available from low cost carriers while such model may have the effect of reducing congestion at hubs its long term systemwide impact on capacity will largely be determined by consumer demand characteristics which ma favor pointtopoint service in some cases particularly along busy competitive routes the ability to address national airspace sy stem capacity needs to large extent hinges on the ability of policymakers to foresee how these marketbased trends will affect airline business practices in the future in this evolving marketplace for aviation services policymakers may need better tools for modeling and predicting market factors and examining the effects of capacity enhancement efforts in the larger context of changing demand characteristics on the aviation system nowhere is this more true than in predicting futu re traffic at major hubs especially since large proportion of these hub operations ar tied to specific business practices of financially troubled air carriers the future of hubs as low cost carriers continue to compete by offering more pointtopoint service in selected markets and legacy carriers follow suit

2006us airways significantly scaled back flight operations from its pittsburgh pit hub to cut costs14 since pit does not have high vol ume of originati on and destination passengers despite having

bankruptcy filing traffic at slc continued to lag behind other delta hubs and delta moved to reduce ma inline flights there and increase the presence of its regional part ners delta connection flights

with the shift toward more regional jet operations is the expansion of regi onal jet hubs like delta conn ections cinci nnatinorthern kentucky cvg facility regional hubs where regi onal partners can

operations will be concentrated is obviously of particular interest for unders tanding future capacity needs however besides the major hubs and major population centers where continued high volumes of operations are likely the longrange outlook for specific large airports may be hard to predict for example saint louislambert field stl lost its status as major hub when american airlines bought twa

operations on the national airspace system can be modeledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs15 and simulated so that decisionmakers nd airspace planners can be better poised to address different growth pa tterns in aviation operations as they unfold the net effect on capacity straining operations the aforementioned trends are expected to contribute to increased flight operations in capacity constrained areas of the national airspace system the types of flight operations considered most likely to be limited by capacity constraints include operations in high altitude ai rspace airspace above 18000 feet referred to as class airspace in congested ai rspace around major metropolitan areas class b and some class c airspace and at busy commercial airports and general aviation reliever airports in major metropolitan areas flight operations of 1 airliners 2 commuter and regional operato rs and 3 general aviation turbinepowered aircraft are considered most likely to impact capacity constrained airports and airspace overall airborne hours in these three categor ies of operations are expected to increase by 44 over the next 10 years see figure 6 the largest percentage growth in airborne hours is expected to be in je tpowered general aviation aircraft 95 followed distantly by large air carriers flying both passenger and cargo operations 39 the expected growth in ai rborne hours among regional and commuter aircraft will not be quite as large but w ill nonetheless be significant 34 large carrier operations which currently represen t 64 of total airborne hours among these three categories will grow more slowly than general aviation jet and commuter and regional operations by 2015 large carrier operations are expected to still make up 61 of these capacity straining

forecasts and capacity growth assumptions the projected growth in aviation operations is likely to outpace projected capacity expansion for the foreseeable future at major metropolitan airports in crowded terminal airspace around major metropolitan regions and ong certain high altitude corridors according to the latest version of the faas operational evolution plan oep while systemwide capacity has increased bout 65 over the past four years it is expected to increase by only 27 by 2013 compared to the effective capacity in 2000 while this reduction in projected capacity enhancement may simply be reflection of different forecasting methods or assumptions or reflection that capacity enhancements in the previous plan were realized sooner than expected it could also be preliminary indicator of future slowing trend in capacity growth there is potential concern that beyond the 10year time frame examined in the oep there may be diminishing marginal gain in capacity over time in other words unless new approaches are applied to the problem of aviation capacity as part of long term strategy it may become mo re and more difficult to enhance system wide capacity using methods

could provide unique challenges to enhancing the capacity of the aviation system to meet the growth in demand for aircraft operations available capacity at major airports to assess available capacity at the nati ons busiest airports the faa conducted capacity benchmark studies in 2001 and 2004 deta iling the available capacity at these airports and comparing this available capacity to actual traffic levels17 in 2001 the faa released its initial capacity benchmark report detailing the maximum number of hourly flights that can be accommodated at the nations 31 busiest airports18 this study defined the envelope of aircraft arrival nd departure rates at these airports under optimum good weat her conditions and under reduced rate conditions when visibility requires radar separation standards and procedures to be implemented the study found that many of the busiest airports including the eight most delayed airports operated close to their available capacity levels and sometimes exceeded these levels during peak hours especially when these peak periods coincided with poor weather conditions ca pacity loss due to weather can be quite significant but varies significantly from airport to airport depending on differences in runway configurations nd foul weather procedures airports such as cincinnati cvg and minneapolisst paul msp have minimal capacity loss during

to include the four airports dded to the list of major airports in the operational evolution plan oep and now provides benchmarks for all oep35 airports the 2001 benchmark study examined forw ardlooking projections of capacity enhancement by 2010 assuming planned runw ays and new technologies would be in place by that time while the 2004 benchmark study projected future benchmarks for the oep35 airports in 2013 under the sa assumptions that planned capacity enhancement work was completed by th at time while the 2001 study found that many capacity enhancement projects such as new runways and new technologies were planned or underway the cumulative capacity enhancement of these projects often fell short of keeping up with projected growth in demand in fact at each of the top six airports in terms of delays projected growth was expected to outpace planned capacity enhancements on average by over 9 percent in good weather and by more than 10 during reduced visibility operations among the 8 airports identified in the study as experiencing significant passenger delays growth in demand through 2010 was expected to average 148 wh ile runways and technologies were expected to increase capacity on average by only 86 in good weather and 77 during reduced visib ility operations over this time period19 not surprisingly the benchmark study conclude d that the top six most delayed airports plus angeles internati onal airport lax ranked 12th overall in passenger delays at the time of the study would continue to experience significant passenger delays through 2010 the 2004 benchmark st udy did not provide growth projections to make similar comparisons however based on the fact that the 2004 benchmark projections of capacity enhancement achie vable by 2013 are comparable to those projected for 2010 in the 2001 benchmark the ex pectation is that growth in aviation operations will continue to outp ace systemwide capacity expansion other trends observed in the 2001 benchm ark study further indicate that despite ongoing and planned expansion projects many airports will be unable to keep up with projected growth in demand for example orlando international airport mco the most popular domestic leisure trav destination is expanding to address an anticipated growth in demand of 42 percent by 2010 compared to 2000 levels however the combined impact of both new fourth runway now in operation and air traffic technologies is ex pected to enhance capacity by only 28 in good weather and 38 in poor weather while this expans ion is significant it is not expected to keep pace with projected growth while mc is expected to see the largest increase in demand through 2010 of the 31 airports st udied several other airports are expected to be unable to increase capacity to meet their anticipated demand growth as well httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs18 of the 31 airports studied in the 2001 be nchmark only 6 are anticipated to grow their capacity at levels sufficient to clearly outpace projected growth in demand through 2010 one of those airports is th atlanta hartsfieldjackson international airport atl where the addition of fift h runway expected to be completed in june 2006 coupled with enhanced air traffic technologies and procedures is expected to increase capacity by 37 in g ood weather and 34 in restricted visibility by 2010 by comparison projected growth at atl during this period is expected to increase by 28 consequently the study concludes that these actions are likely to alleviate delays for the past three years the downturn in demand for aviation since september 11 2001 has alleviated some of the need to implement this technology in the near term however anticipated future growth is likely to prompt the need for implementing these types of capacitye nhancing capabilities the 2001 benchmark study concluded that new runways whic h were planned at 14 of the 31 airports examined can provide the most significant increases forecast increases on the order of 30 to 60 percent appear achievable at most airports from the addition of new runways for some airports that already have high capacity layouts like denver den an additional runway provides much smaller gain in capacity and in some cases new runways do not appear to be the solution to increasing capacity at all specifically the 2004 benchmark points to bostons logan international airport bos as location that will not be able to expand capacity by adding new runway the new runway at bos expected to ope n in 2006 is anticipated to have impact whatsoever on increasing capacity however the new runway is expected to mitigate delays during poor weather ssuming ground infrastructure and environmental constraints support the operati onal plans for this runway despite some exceptions like boston build ing new runways is seen as having the largest systemwide impact on expa nding capacity in addition technology enhancements are seen as providing additional capacity gains in the range of 3 to 8 and procedural enhancemen ts could provide another 5 to 10 gain in available capacity at airports while technology and procedural solutions will play small but important part of expanding capacity at airports they are likely to play more central role in expanding the capacity of route and terminal airspace airspace design the national airspace system has evolved over the years into its present day form consisting of web of routes inte rconnected by ground based navigational aids called very high frequency om nidirectional range vor st ations these routes or airways are often likened to highways in the sky along these airways instead of using lanes opposite direction traffic is separated by altit udes however restricting airplanes to airways does not make use of all available airspace this can create congestion on the airways which is co mpounded by large vertical separation requirements implemented to keep aircraft at safe distances that were established decades ago to allow for errors in altitude equipment and altitude deviation by pilots that today can be effectively controlled by more precise instru mentation and cockpit automation to detect and prevent unintended altitude deviations also following airways sometimes requires zigzagging between points along the airway rather than proceeding directly to the destination airport while these maneuvers only add fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs19 extra minutes to typical flight the additi onal fuel burn can be very significant for an airline or aircraft operator therefore flying the most direct routes between origin and destination can be benefi cial for air traffic management as well as operational efficiency faa is currently laying th regulatory and operational frameworks for such operations referred to by many as free flight based on precision satellite navigation capabilities using the global positioning system gps augmented by groundbased signals to better pinpoint an aircrafts position in space besides limitations imposed by the current airway system high altitude airspace is also limited by the number of available altitudes or flight levels fls that airplanes can travel on opposite direction tr affic has historically been separated by 2000 foot altitude spacing above 18000 feet to ensure adequate separation in cases of instrument or pilot error however with improved altitude measurement and monitoring capabilities the faa is phasing in the use of 1000 foot altitude spacing this reduction in altitude spacing down to 1000 feet referred to as reduced vertical separation minimums or rvsm has virtually the same ffect as doubling the number of lanes on an interstate highway rvsm is initially being implemented between 29000 feet and 41000 feet fl290 to fl410 it has already been implemented between these altitudes on oceancrossing flights and will be implemented in domestic airspace by january 2005 airp lanes must meet special equipment requirements to operate at these altitudes rvsm will likely be expanded to include all high altitude airspace above 18000 feet specifically fl180 to fl600 in the future in order to manage and control the flow of high altitude traffic airspace is broken up into regions or centers which ar further subdivided into sectors one significant factor affecting the design of the national airspace system and its capacity is air traffic controller workload current demand characteristics result in concentration of eastwest operations in airspace be tween chicago boston and washington dc the high altitude airspace monitored by controllers in cleveland center is especially busy as this tends to be the bottleneck for flights transiting between the west coast and chicago and cities in the northeast there is also heavy concentration of northsouth traffi c between norfolk and richmond virginia and new york and to lesser extent along the california coast especially between angeles and san francisco in these areas controller workload and the segmentation of airspace to manage that workload can be significant constraining factor affecting capacity in high altitude airspace the strategies that the faa has adopted to address these constraints is heavily focused on the use of technology automa tion and pilot and controller decision aids along with airspace redesign to assist with both the management and control of air traffic in high altitude airspace these initia tives are discussed in further detail in the section titled the free flight concept controller staffing another challenge facing the faa is maintaining an adequate staff of air traffic controllers atcs to meet operational need s in the past between 1 and 2 of the controller workforce became eligible for retirement each year there is current upward trend in the percentage of controllers that will be eligible for retirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs20 20 us general accounting office federal

will peak at almost 10 per year in 2007 and remain above 5 per year through 2011 the faa has estimated that 7100 controllers roughly 45 of its current workforce will retire over the next eight years20 several factors are contributing to high demand for air traffic controllers over the next 10 years foremost is the hiri ng wave in the early 1980s that occurred following the 1981 dismissal of over 11000 striki ng controllers since an air traffic controller career in the united states is structured around 25year service model it is to be expected that those hired in 1982 as many current controllers were would be at or near the end of their careers by 2007 another factor is the lengthy training required to fully train and certify an air tr affic controller which typically takes about two to four years to comple depending on the area of sp ecialization as controllers retire shortages of fully trained controllers for sp ecific positions could occur especially if staffing allocations and appropriate training is not initiated well in advance of anticipated retirements another factor affecting controller staffing is the high labor costs for atcs these high labor costs are heavily influenced by the fact that many controllers are at senior levels in the pay scale and understaffing at many facilities requires extensive use of overtime21 the potential impact of these high labor rates on addressi ng staffing shortages is that it may take away from available funding needed to recruit hire and train the next generation of atcs however the number of air traffic controller positions is actually expected to increase only modestly at rate sligh tly greater than 1 per year through 201222 therefore other than addressing the pending wave of retirements and filling vacant slots at air traffic control facilitie s during that time it is not expected that there will be significant expansion in the numbers of controllers needed rather staffing requirements are expected to be relatively flat for the foreseeable future in the long term the increased use of au tomation and implementation of free flight concepts may reduce some demand for contro llers and shift some controller functions to more strategic air traffic management positions airspace redesign to address controller workload in busy airspace c ould create need for some additional controller positions however little overall growth in the total number of air traffic controller positions is anticipated future technological advances could however result in shift in where controllers are needed the implementation of freeflight concepts coupled with termin airspace redesign in busy metropolitan areas may for example result in fewer controllers being needed to operate route facilities and an increased demand for controllers in terminal radar approach control tracon facilities especially in major metropolitan areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs21 23 statement of alexis m stefani

comprehensive human capital workforce strategy to determine the mo st effective method for addre ssing the need for more air traffic controllers the faas plan released in december 2004 calls for hiring controllers at faster rate over the next 10 years to offset the wave of retirements and improve selection and training the faa also anticipates that improved workload efficiency and scheduling practices will reduce projections of staffing needs by 10 over the next 10 years however the dot inspector generals office has noted that the faa needs better locationspecific projections of attrition rates to better gauge future staffing needs23 faas initial plan did not include this locationspecific information on future staffing projecti ons however the faa is working on detailed assessment of staffing needs for each facility based on size complexity and traffic volume various options are under considerati on to address the faas atc staffing needs and funding challenges associated with meeting these staffing requirements one proposal offered has been to either grant age waivers to controllers allowing them to work beyond 56 or to raise th statutory retirement age proponents of raising the retirement age indicate that with better health and wellness of aging adults controllers may be able to perform safely and efficiently at older ages research on cognitive performance of aging atcs and the potential long term health effects of atc workload and stress how ever is contentious and does not provide clearcut answers to policy questions regarding the appropriate retirement ages for controllers similarly contentious issue is the mandatory retirement age of 60 for airline pilots in both of these cases the establishment of retirement age is based loosely on the research findings of medi cal and performance studies of aging and long range effects of jobre lated stress but is influenced by other factors such as annuity calculations for retirement in general research shows gradua l decline in cognitive abilities beyond age 30 that becomes more pronounced in the span between 60 and 70 years not surprisingly there are large individual di fferences that make pinpointing specific age where skills and abilities to perform at c tasks decline precipitously while atcs have to pass annual hea lth exams these only provide very cursory evaluation of cognitive abilities therefore the potential impact of raising the atc retirement age above 56 or granting waivers on syst em safety is largely unknown for this reason proposals to raise the retirement age are likely to be contentious in the near term raising the retirement age could put off the need to hire and train new atcs for few years and lesse n the impact of pending retirements

of service beyond their eligible retirement date or providing retention bonuses as incentives to expe rienced controllers to stay in their positions may also be considered as tools to spread the projected retirement wave out over greater number of years however any such proposal is likely to be cont roversial as it would create funding impact that may limit the faas resources to hire and train replacement controllers also many believe that atc labor costs at the faa are already too high freezing or limiting wages of current controllers is also viewed by some as possible option to free up funds for hiring nd training new atcs but this option has several disadvantages first the cost sa vings would likely take few years to have great enough impact to provide the n eeded funding for hiring and training replacement atcs second such action may prompt current controllers to enter retirement at faster rate t hus negating the intent of the action and finally freezing wages could have negative effect on recruiting efforts if prospective applicants view it as an indicator of futu re salary potential with the faa the faa is also mulling the idea of requiring newly hired atcs to pay for their initial training as means to reduce the federal burden of training the next generation of air traffic controllers while the faa notes that many airline pilots must pay for their initial training this option may significantly limit the pool of interested applicants for atc positions especially gi ven that the marketplace for applicants with technical aptitude similar to that needed to be an atc is highly competitive another possible option for congress is to provide special funding for the purposes of hiring and training the ne xt generation of atc specialists fy2005 appropriations included 95 million for this purpose for fy2006 the house bill included almost 25 million to increase th faa workforce by 595 air traffic controllers however the final appropr iations act pl 109115 did not include specific reference to this amount faced with budget constraints and rising operational costs it is uncertain how the faa will allocate funding to address the continuing need for succession planning hiri ng and training of air traffic controllers in the near term if controller shortages persist there may be need to increase overtime and perhaps impose mandatory overtime for controller staff such practices may impact safety because it may contribute to c ontroller fatigue additionally 2002 gao survey found that use of mandatory overtime may result in more controllers

foster cooperative and collaborative work toward achieving this vision cost overruns the faas original plan to modernize the air traffic control system began in the early 1980s and was estimated to be co mpleted by the early 1990s at projected cost of 12 billion central element of that modernization effort the advanced automation system aas was ultimately scrapped in large part after large cost overruns schedule delays and failures to deliver promised capabilities and performance according to the gao since then faas cost estimates have mushroomed and schedules ve continued to slip over 35 billion have been spent so far on modernizing the national airspace system and the faa estimates it will need an additional 16 billion th rough 2007 to complete key projects34 in fairness to the faa it is important to point out that many of the system modernization projects included in its current efforts to increase system capacity were not even conceived of in the early 1980s the efforts of the early 1980s that extended into the 1990s were largely aimed at improving the existing route and terminal radar networks by upgrading hardware nd software and providing controllers with improved workstations and consoles and r udimentary automation tools these efforts focused largely on air traffic communications and surveillance and largely did not address enhancement to navigation capabilities the global positioning systems gps network of navigation satellites did not exist when the program was initiated therefore programs like waas and free flight were not initially calculated into cost projections gps and gpsrelate d technologies the enabling technologies allowing revoluti onary new navigational concepts like free flight to be implemented have only been considered as part of faas air traffic control modernization plans for the past 10y ears or so in essence looking broadly at the current costs to enhance faa facilities and equipment compared to past cost estimates is not fair comparison however what is clear is that on program by program basis faa spending on atc mode rnization efforts has been riddled with cost overruns and schedule slips

found and continues to identify inadequate cost controls cost estimating and cost accounting within faa as significant impediment to effective management of large scale acquisition programs also the faa still does not have sufficiently detailed blueprint tying its major acquisition programs to modernization objectives for the air traffic control system and does not adequately link these programs to both n ear term and longrange budget projections35 one of the principal objectives of the new ato and jpto is to address these concerns time will tell if these new or ganizations are effective in meeting this objective and it is likely that the work of these organizations will be subject of considerable congressi onal interest over the next several years russell chew the coo of the ato is well

proposals presently the effect of capacity constraints are beginning to be felt once again as demand for air travel returns to pr eseptember 11 2001 levels throughout the summer of 2004 increased

record setting demand for air travel long bout with thunderstorms particularly in th busy northeast corridor and at major hubs like dallasfort worth chicago and atlanta and aircraft maintenance difficulties conspired to produce long delays and can celled flights that wreaked havoc on many travelers plans this difficult time for travelers was followed by even more acute delays during the 2000 holiday season in december during these periods air travelers experienced the worst delays in us aviation history and delays frequently exceeded acceptable levels38 following this period the us economy entered downturn that reduced demand for air travel meanwhile the faa was busy implementing near term solutions to avoi d repeat of the summer of 2000 the net result was less traffic volume and signifi cantly fewer and shorter delays in the summer of 2001 since then airline travel si gnificantly declined in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and as might be expected delays have been significantly less in the past three years recent statistics released by the department of transportations bureau of transportation statistics indicate that delays are on the rise although not to the level seen in the summer of 2000 see figures 7 8 while the decrease in demand for air travel from 2001 to 2004 in essence bought the faa additional time to study and implement near term solutions to alleviate congestion and delay the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains largely undetermined and over the past two years key delay statistics have been steadilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs30 rising possible indicator of increasing strain on system capacity as traffic volume increases and surpasses pre september 11 2001 levels over the next few

data in figures 7 8 it is notable that while the monthly average departure delay has typically been greater than monthly average arrival delay greater proportion of rrivals are delayed more than 15 minutes compared to departures39 thus from operational sta ndpoint airborne delays that impact arrival times while less frequent than delays affecting departure times are more likely to be longer in duration given that airborne delays are costly to airlines in terms of fuel costs increased wear and tear on the engines and so on specific operational strategies to reduce these ai rborne delays woul d be particularly advantageous to airlines and other aircra ft operators faa has been working with the airlines to take such steps to reduce airborne delays so examples include using ground holds to delay depart ures in order to better space arrivals at destin ation airports using decision aids to meter the flow of arrivals into busy airports and creating express lanes into and out of busy airports by holding traffic at satellite and reliever airports during peak travel hours it appears that these efforts were somewhat effective in staving off repeat of delays such as those experienced in the summer of 2000 during the peak travel months of 2004 and 2005 however the upwar d trend in delay st atistics especially arrival delays during the peak summer nd holiday travel seasons of 2004 and 2005 could be forewarning that chronic dela conditions may return to the aviation system as operations surge past presept ember 11 2001 levels ove r the next several years the relationship between capacity and delay while the faa continues to implement stopgap measures to mitigate delay in the current national airspace system most observers recognize that the long term solutions to alleviating congestion and delay should address the underlying capacity constraints since delay is key sympto m of strain on system capacity delay can be mitigated to some extent by investing in capacityenhancing infrastructure and technologies however in practice polic ymakers and system pl anners must balance tradeoff between meeting demand for aviation services while maintaining delays within acceptable levels given that growth in aviation operations may easily outpace capacity enhancement of the national airspace system for the foreseeable future policymakers will likely face t ough choices in meeting demand without increasing delay the faas oep version 60 project s 27 overall capacity enhancement by 2013 however this capacity enhancemen t assumes that an average system delay of 14 minutes is acceptable and does not seek to reduce this level of delay in its projections of future system capability rather the faa intends to increase capacity at what it has set as threshold acceptable

the tradeoff betw een expanding capacity and mitigating delayhave grown accustomed to but not the extent of delays experienced in the summer of 2000 the potential danger of this strate gy is that with an emphasis on enhancing capacity to meet growth in demand delay may increase significantly in capacity constrained system especially if capacity enhancement effort s fall behind schedule or fail to fully meet expectations figure 9 shows conceptually the tradeoff that exists between capacity and delay in essence these two metrics comprise elements that compete for system capability in reality the situation is much more complex since the relationship between capacity and delay is influenced significantly by external factors such as weather and airline scheduling practices that are either uncont rollable or not contro lled directly within the system certainly the relationship be tween capacity and dela and the influence of both system variables and external fact ors on these two metrics is very complex while the tradeoff relationship between capacity and delay may be difficult to quantify or predict the effect is relatively easy to conceptualize working from baseline capacity cb enhanced system capabilities can be projected to enhance capacity assuming fixed level of delay cfd the faa chose to conceptualize capacity enhancement in this manner selecting fixed systemwide acceptable level of delay of 14 minutes figure never exceeded before the infamous summer of 2000 as its target where cb is baseline capacity that is current available capacity crd is future capacity with reduced delay cfd is future capacity assuming fixed delay and cid is future capacity assuming an increase in delay source bureau of transportation statistics average delay data and faa oep version 60 fixed level of delay for assessing effective capacityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs33 while the faas objective is to meet growth in demand while maintaining delays at 14 minutes or less consumer complaints tend to focus on system delays rather than available capacity therefore reducing delay might be reasonable objective for enhancing system capability in figure 9 it can be seen that at least conceptually capacity can be traded fo r reduction in delay within the bounds of system capability so the capacity enhancement achievable with reduced delay crd is not as large as the capacity reduction with fixed delay cfd however delays could potentially be reduced along with less significant gain in capacity crd if reducing delay was targeted as an objective of system enhancement conversely capacity could grow larger lthough not as significantly due to other constraining factors if delays were allowed to increase that is the conceptual increase in capacity with increased delay cid is greater than the capacity enhancement with fixed delay cfd as the capability of the national airspace system expands it is largely policy decision whether the enhanced capability will be used primarily for increasing capacity or for decreasing delay howe ver the faas forecast that growth is expected to meet or exceed planned capacity improvements provides reasonable justification for adopting policy of projecting capacity expansion while attempting to maintain fixed level of delay capacity is projected to at best parallel expected growth through 2010 therefore essentially all of the pr ojected enhancements to be engineered into the national airspace system by that time will be needed to meet the forecast growth in aviation operations therefore if demand is to be met enhancements are not likely to be available for mitigating delay furthermore system enhancement efforts are likely to have greater impact on increasing capacity rather than decreasing existing delay given that delay is constrained to greater extent by external factors such as weather and airline scheduling practices that are more difficult to control also given the complexity of tradeoffs between capacity and delay using fixed level of delay in projecting future effective capacity simplifies the comparison to baseline capacity levels an alternative strategy that would involve core conceptual changes in policy would value system efficiency over capacity and target reducing lays such an approach may involve various market based strategies discussed later in this report to reduce demand characteristics for aviation operations in addition to system enhancements targ eting delay reduction while more efficient national airspace system may improve the satisfaction of many consumers it is likely to increase associated costs by limiting the supply of aviation services therefore such sh ift in policy regarding the objectives for modernizing the national airspace system could be contentious impact of congestion on aviation safety as demand for air transportation continue s to grow increasing flight operations may introduce additional risks to aviation safety that may need to be addressed if the system is to maintain or improve upon its current level of safety while at the same time addressing capacity needs the faas ato has identified two key indicators of safety

reduction in incu rsion rate is meaningful and even more difficult to attribute it to specific actions taken to reduce the rate and severity of incursions furthermore the reduction in severity levels obs erved between 2001 and 2002 has appeared to flatten this may indicate that the effects of currently implemented mitigation strategies have already been largely realized if this is the case then more may need to be done to keep the overall numbers of category and b incursions to minimum this is because even if the severe incursion rate is held constant increasing number of operations will bring with them likely increases in the number of severe incursions while more data is needed to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the reduction in risk of runway incursions these trends are at least promising and the faa is continuing its efforts to implement operational and technological approaches to fu rther reduce runway incursions of the oep35 airports 7 had 15 or more incursions over the four year period from 20002003 these airports were chicag oohare ord dallasfort worth dfw angeles international l ax phoenix sky harbor phx boston logan bos saint louis stl and san francisco international sfo traffic density was certainly major contributing factor in the number of runway incursions experienced at an airport four of th 7 airports were among the top 5 busiest airports in the united states the faa recognizes that traffic volume is major factor in runway incursions since incr eases in operations increase the number of opportunities for error however the faa found that annual fluctu ations in traffic volume did not have predictable effects on r unway incursions rates thus traffic volume appears to interact with airportsp ecific characteristics to affect the likelihood of runway incursions in complex ways that are not yet fully understood the highest number of runway incurs ions 34 and the largest number of category b incursions 12 over the 20002003 period for the oep35 airports was observed at lax which ranks fourth overall in number of operations and has complex taxiway layout however l ax had category b incursions in 2003 suggesting that while they have b een unable to reduce the annual number of incursions at that airport strategies to mitigate the severity of incursion incidents appear to be working there efforts to date have primarily focused on outreach to increase pilot runway safety awareness improved signs pavement markings and lighting and procedural modifica tion to improve ope rational safety besides high traffic density the attributes that those airports experiencing higher numbers of runway incursions appear to share include complex taxiway and runway layouts and complex taxi pr ocedures some but not ll of these airports have intersecting runways which also present opportunities for runway incursions to occur the runway incursion risk of intersec ting runways could have implications for capacityenhancing opera tional procedures such as land and hold short operations lasho in which pilots of landing aircraft are required to stop before reaching crossing runway so that simultaneous operations can be c onducted on both runways clearly other airports share these attribut as well and procedures such as lasho have been used safely for many years therefore the specific factors that make an airport more vulnerable to runway incurs ions are not yet completely clear how airportspecific factors such as infrastructure procedures operations and environment interact with traffic density to define the runway incursion risk for specific airport is not fully understood and continues to be scrutinized by the faahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs37 46 faa office of runway safety runway safety report

involving commercial aircraft and incurs ions occurring at the oep35 airports deviations by vehicles nd pedestrians operating in th air operations area comprise the remaining runway incursions consequently mitigation measures to reduce runway incursions are likely to have the greatest benefit if they can reduce the number of pilot deviations during surface movement however faas efforts to date in terms of high cost technology options including ground radar airport surface detection equipment asde and the airport movement area safety system amass are primarily focuse d on improving air traffic controller situation awareness regarding traffic position and the potential for incursions in 2001 the ntsb evaluated the air port movement area safety system amass and determined that it was not cap able of providing sufficient warning to prevent runway collisions in all instances and as currently imp lemented provides capability to issue warnings directly to pilots and other vehicle operators47 i n essence the amass system inserts controllers into the decision cycle thereby increasing the time needed for pilots to take evasive action to prevent collision providing traffic information and alerting directly to pilots as opposed to only alerting controllers would be preferable in this regard but this is not what the ntsbs original recommendation sought rather the ntsb specifically asked the faa to develop system analogous to cockpit traffic collision avoidance systems tcas to alert controllers to pending runway incursions48 however tcas provides alerts nd conflict

being imp lemented or are under study by the faa and nasa mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of runway incursions can be placed into six general categories as shown in table 1 these various strategies are mainly aimed at improving pilot and controller situational awareness regarding aircraft position relative to other aircraft and ground vehi cles aircraft and vehicle position relative to assigned taxi routes and active runways and flight crew and vehicle operator understanding of taxi instructions and runway clearances other solutions seek to provide controllers and pilots with

inspector general reviewed severity ratings for 13 months of operational error data collected from may 2001through may 2002 and found that 78 per cent were classified as moderate severity and 6 were classified as high severity while only 22 were classified as low severity52 the dot inspector generals repor t concluded that much work needs to be done to reduce the sever ity of operational errors

itoring of the program may be needed both the dot inspector general and the ntsb have criticized faa policy and agreements with controllers that limits the use of remedial training following operational errors faa polic does not require the faa to impose remedial training following low severity operational error and prohibits followon training if the controller took corrective actions during the c ourse of the event even for controllers who have moderate or high severity operational errors remedial training is not required also faa policy prohibits s upervisors from revoking or suspending controller certificates and facility ratings on the basis of performance deficiencies in light of these findings the dot insp ector general concluded that faa needs to strengthen its actions to address controller performance deficiencies highlighted by operational errors even with improved oversight and safety regulation of air traffic facilities operational errors can still pose serious safe ty risks in essence backup capabilities are needed to assure aircraft separation by alerting controllers and pilots when loss of separation occurs and poses threat of collision between two aircraft these aids include conflict alert ca algorithms to alert controllers to impending loss of separation events and tcas to provide p ilots with traffic awareness and conflict resolutions for preventing midair collisions the august 31 1986 collision of an aerome xico d9 and small private plane over cerritos california hi ghlighted growing concerns over the risk of midair collisions and prompted the faa to promulgate regulations phasing in the use of airborne traffic collision avoidance systems tcas on airliners and commuter aircraft53 currently faa regulations stipulate that passenger air carrier flights be equipped with an operating tcas system th at provides visual and aural advisories of traffic conflicts additionally all ai rcraft operating near the nations busiest airports are required to use altitude report equipment mode c or mode s transponders that transmit aircraft pos ition and altitude to tcas devices since these requirements have gone into effect there has not been midair collision involving tcasequi pped aircraft in us airs pace however tcas is not required on all airplanes regulations stipulate that only passenger airliners and jet and turboprop air taxi and commuter flights with seating for 10 or more passengers must be equipped with tca54s thus most cargo aircraft business jets and many charter aircraft are not required to install or use tcas one option to increase safety as operati ons increase in congested airspace would be to require the use of tcas systems fo r other users of the aviation system this may be particularly important given the large anticipated increases in business jet andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs42 cargo jet operations over the next 10 years however alternative technologies such as automated dependent surveillancebroadcast adsb with cockpit display of traffic information cdti or traffi c information systems tis have the potential to offer tcaslike capabilities at significantly lower cost which may be particularly attractive to general aviation users of business jets and minijets thus alternative technical standards for traffic awareness and alerting systems may be able to adequately address safety concerns regarding traffic collision avoidance in the near future congress may pursue the implement ation of such systems through either legislation or oversight of faa regulatory activities possible strategies for enhancing capacity while maintaining safety and efficiency there are numerous approaches to enha ncing capacity of the national airspace system under development and evaluation th core policy issue is determining the right mix for investing in airport infrast ructure technology and modifications to operational procedures in order to grow cap acity at rate commensurate with growth in demand while at the same time maintaining the efficiency and safety that aviation consumers expect the aviation community has invested great deal in future concepts for air traffic management and control that are just beginning to mature and take shape in the operational framework of the national airspace system additionally airports conti nue to expand and reconfigur to enhance their capacity and improve operational effici ency however these measures may not be enough to meet demand without eroding the efficiency and possibly the safety of air travel consequently policymakers are continuing to evaluate marketbased strategies to alter the demand characteristics for aviation operations so that operations can continue at level that is safe and meets consumer expectations of efficiency in resource constrained system the freeflight concept over the next decade the current model of the national airspace system is expected to change dramatically virtua lly all airliners and business jets now have onboard capabilities such as area naviga tion equipment rnav global positioning system gps receivers and inertial guidance systems that provide precise aircraft position data without sole reliance on gr oundbase d vors thus allowing pilots to fly directly from airport to airport however allowing aircraft to fly direct to their destination presents significant challenges to air traffic managers and controllers that are currently being worked out under concept called free flight since free flight is an evolving concept the term is used both loosely to describe conceptual aspects of future air traffic systems allowing aircraft to fly along direct routes and deviate as needed to avoid weather and traffic as well as more concretely to describe suite of air traffic management atm and air tra ffic control atc tools being developed and tested by the faa to allow greater flexibility in aircraft routing one step in the process toward implementing free flight is to redefine the structure of high altitude airspace around pointtopoint di rect routes that appropriately equi pped aircraft can utilize the faa began doing this in july 2003 defining and charting high altitude routes designated by inte rnational conventionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs43 55 the faa has defined advanced aircraft navigational performance capabilities broadly under the umbrella of what they call area navi gation or rnav equipment by establishing performance standards in this manner it does not limit operators to any specific technology to meet the required navigational performance to perform certain operations in this sense the faa has moved away from technical standards and instead had adopted performance standards for future navigation capabilities at present the aircraft technology needed to meet these performance standards include wide area augmentation system waas enabled gps receivers and inertial reference units irus the use of groundbased rnav systems developed in the 1970s that rely on vor receivers and distance measuring equipment dme to navigate using more di rect routing is being evaluated under this framework but is not currently approved for high altitude airspace in this report the term precision satellite navigation capabilities refers to the waas enabled gps technology which is one of two core enabling technologies of emerging free flight operational concepts in the usas q routes in the us and canada for use by aircraft with precision satellite navigation capabilities55 one major challenge in implementing the free flight concept is defining how much autonomy each aircraft will have during the route portion of flight currently aircraft in high altitude airsp ace can only fly along th specific course and altitude profile that air traffic control has approved or cleared thus in the present system atc has direct control over every ai rcraft in high altitude airspace under free flight model it is likely that pilots w ould have some degree of autonomy regarding their flight path for example in the current system if pilot sees thunderstorm ahead he or she must reque st deviation around the storm from atc under the proposed free flight model the pilot may be able to deviate around the storm without formally receiving permission to do so by atc similarly pilots may have some degree of autonomy regarding deviations for traffic altitudes and airspeeds deviations to avoid or mitigate turbulence and increas fuel economy and so on this would shift the atc role for high altitude airspace from direct control to supervisory control function where at c would monitor traffic in given sector of airspace and resolve conflicts as well as provide advisories and instructions to maintain appropriate aircraft spacing and lleviate congestion at destination airports in the future the route controller is also likely to take on more active role as an interface between aircraft and air traffic management atm functions within the faa that will apply more complex analyses of the overall traffic picture to more efficiently control the flow of ai r traffic throughout the system second major challenge in implementing free flight model for the national airspace system is handling the transiti ons from the busy terminal airspace around an origin airport to the rout phase of flight along these routes and from the route segment to the approach phase of flight when aircraft enter busy terminal airspace around destination airport the working concept to address this challenge is by using what are referred to as pitch and catch points to define specific transition points into and out from busy terminal airspace under this concept aircraft would fly predefined departure routes much as they do today except with the aid of precision satellite navigation to pitch point where the would then proceed semi autonomously via direct routing to catch point where they would enter the terminal airspace at the destination airpor t and follow predefined approach routes orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs44 atc instructions to arrive at the destination airport thus at least in the near term the free flight implementation that is most likely to emerge is one in which aircraft will operate semiautonom ously in high altitude airspace between pitch and catch points and will operate unde r more direct control of atc when transiting busy terminal airspace during departure and before landing the core enabling technology needed to implement navigation under free flight system precision satellite navigation is already mature the other element needed to enable free flight assuring safe sepa ration between aircraft involves more complex in terplay between onboard tec hnologies and air traffic management and control tools onboard technologies for traffic awareness and separation include tcas systems which ar already widely deployed the other onboard technology for traffic awareness nd separation in aircraft is automatic dependent surveillance broadcast adsb technology capable of broadcasting aircraft position information to other aircraft and to air traffic control and displaying traffic information in the cockpit unlik tcas which uses onboard radar and radar based air traffic control displays adsb will rely predominantly on satellitebased aircraft position data using gps the poten tial advantage of this technology is that it can provide common traffic picture that is the capability for pilots and controllers and air traffic managers to have shared situation awareness regarding nearby traffic and potential conflicts such capability is seen as step toward providing pilots with more autonomy re garding navigation and separation while such technology has significant potential and has been implemented successfully in various operational tests pe rformed under the faas safe flight 21 program much work is still needed to create systemwid infrastructure to support this technology much work is also still needed to deve lop decision support tools and automation that can assist air traffic manage rs controllers and pilots to handle traffic and weather conflicts finally much work still needs to be done on the human factors and system design of free flight system to more clearly define the roles and protocols for air traffic managers cont rollers and pilots the faa is in the process of defining the regulatory structure to permit limited operations exploiting this technology howe ver significant work is still needed to create seamless integrated free flight system throughout the domestic us airspace as shown in table 2 there is still considerable risk associated with integrating and implementing free flight concepts in the national airspace system at this point this risk exists although the core enabling technologies are relatively mature because extensive systems integration is still needed in order to utilize these technologies to provide seamless navigati on communications surveillance and air traffic management capabilities throughout the most complex airspace system in the world despite ongoing reform with the creati on of the ato and the jpdo the faas capability to implement free flight also introduces an element of risk because of the faas history of cost overruns schedule delays and failures to meet performance objectives in managing large scale programs given the relatively high level of risk associated with implementing free flight concepts this could be an area of continued congressional oversight over the next several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs45 56 high altitude airspace as used in this report refers to airspace between 18000 feet and 60000 feet

established to correct management deficiencies at faa but are too new to assess their effectiveness faa is implementing incremental spiral development processes and other acquisition reforms to address concerns reducing separation standards in parallel with the faas efforts to introduce free flight concepts in the national airspace system the faa is implementing initiatives to reduce the separation between aircraft both in high altitude airspace and in the terminal environment near airports reducing separation is seen as an important strategy for increasing capacity in congested airspace for example reducing vertical separa tion from 2000 feet to 1000 feet in high altitude airspace56 in essence doubles route capacity although actual capacity enhancement through rvsm is likely to be constrained to some degree by factors such as airspace configuration and air tr affic controller workload that may limit the number of aircraft that can be handled within an air traffic control

while precision satellitebased navigation is currently the principal tec hnology for meeting rnp standards these standards allow for the use of other tec hnologies including yet to be developed technologies to meet navigati onal performance standards example will technology and operational procedures allow for this increase in capacity to be fully exploited nonetheless in the near term rvsm is expected to have numerous benefits including reduced fuel burn from improved r outing altitude selection and delay reduction increased air traffic sector capacity throughput and efficiency increased controller flexibility for resolving weather and traffic conflicts decreased controller workload by providing controllers with more options reduction in conflict points in high density traffic areas and enhanced predictability by allowing aircraft to use requested altitudes in high altitude airspace efforts are unde rway to reduce the vertical separation between aircraft from 2000 feet to 1000 feet rvsm requirements are now in effect for many oceanic and intern ational flights ope rated between 29000 feet fl290 and 41000 feet fl410 domestic rvsm re quirements covering the lower 48 states and alaska will be required by january 2005 the domestic rvsm implementation will make six additional flight levels available for operations between fl 290410 according to the faa rvsm has been shown to enhance aircraft operating efficiency by making more fueltime efficient flight levels available and enhance air traffic control flexibility in addition to providing the potential for enhanced route airspace capacity while rvsm is designed to target capac ity expansion in high altitude airspace reducing separation standards near airports is seen as an important strategy to improving capacity and efficiency of arri vals and departures one major hurdle to overcome in implementing this strategy is that many airports have been built with runways that are too close together to support simultaneous arrivals using current separation requirements therefore the faa is working on technology and procedures to reduce the separation between aircraft operating to closely spaced parallel runways by providing pilots and controllers with precision aircraft and traffic position information that will allow operati ons to continue under visual separation rules during periods of marginal inflight visibility in the future aircraft meeting specific levels of navigational accuracy called required navigation performance or rnp57 in aviation parlance may be able to use cockpit

avoid nearby traffic approaching parallel runways in virtually all weather conditions like free flight reduced separation standards in the terminal environment near airports are likely to rely heavily on precision satellite na vigation cap abilities provided by the global positioning syst em gps augmented by groundbased stations that provide increased precisi on in the gps signal the faa has two systems for precision satellite navigati on the recently commissioned wide area augmentation system waas that provide s systemwide coverage and the higher resolution local area augmentation sy stem laas which may provide more precise navigation capability for precision landings during low visibility operations at selected airports while waas is operationally available laas is still in early testing phases of operational testing and there are some that still question whether the improvement in navigational accuracy of current laas systems over waas is enough to justify their cost58 the faa turned on the waas network on july 10 2003 and is now phasingin landing procedures that can exploit the precision vertical nd lateral navigation capabilities of gpswaas waas is milest one achievement because it offers the potential for precision vertical and lateral navigational guidance to practically any runway in the united states in addition to providing improved accuracy of aircraft position data needed to reduce aircraft separa tion standards59 in terms of capacity enhancement w aas provides two key benefits first waas can be used as means to allow more precise spacing of aircraft on approach to an airport this can permit runway utilization to better approach optimal levels in the future the precision of waas abled gps position data may allow for the reduced separation of aircra ft on approach and may also reduce the separation of aircraft arriving on clos ely spaced parallel runways the second way waas can enhance capacity is by providing precision landing capabilities to many general aviation reliever airports in poor weathe r the only available landing sites with precision landing capabilities offered by current airportbased instrument landing systems ils are often commercial airports and large general aviation reliever airports consequently commercial airports often see increased general aviation activity during poor weather because general av iation aircraft are fo rced to use these landing facilities with new instrument approach procedures exploiting waas enabled gps navigation numerous other air ports can potentially relieve commercial airports of general aviation traffic durin g reduced visibility c onditions thus the potential benefit of precisi on satellite navigation extends beyond providing the capability to reduce separation standards httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs48 60 david hughes the silent crisisautomation and decision aiding for air traffic management the future national airspace system is likely to make extensive use of automation and decision aiding tools to more efficiently manage traffic flow in free flight environment with reduced aircraft paration many experts see automation and decision aiding tools as core element of the next generation airspace system that will allow users to more fully exploit the capabilities of precision satellite navigation and enhanced communications and surveillance capabilities according to the jpdo director charles keegan central concept of the ngats is to rely extensively on the automation of core air tr affic management functions such as flow control and the metering or spacing of aircraft60 the faa and nasa are actively engaged in the research and development of several tools that may some day provide essential auto mation and decision aiding capabilities to air traffic managers controllers and pilots in the future national airspace system one precursor to future decision aiding capabilities to enable users to exploit route free flight concepts is the user re quest evaluation tool uret currently being deployed at route air traffic facilities uret predicts and notifies controllers of potential conflicts between aircraft or special activity airspace and provides conflict ssessments of proposed flight pa th changes presently uret has been deployed at six air r oute traffic control centers rtccs as part of the first phase of faas free flight implementation and installation at the remaining 14 artccs is underway as part of the second phase of free flight implementation another component of high altitude free flight enabling technology is the traffic management advisor tma strategic planning tool for high altitude controllers and traffic management specialists the tma is used for arrival schedule planning to implement time base d metering or sequencing of aircraft for the handoff between route phases of flight and approach to airports in congested airspace related tool designed to also improve flow contro l is the passive final approach spacing tool or pfast as the name suggests pfast has been designed to serve as decision aid for controllers to better optimize traffic flow during the final approach to runway while these tools are currently making their way into air traffic control centers and approach control facilities they may not offer complete solutions to air traffic management extensive work is still likely to be needed to integrate these various tools and concepts on systemwide level in order to enable more optimal utilization of airspace and more fficient flow of air traffic in the future integrated air traffic management concepts and collaborative decision making are likely to increase in importance and allow the faa to develop strategies and tactics for handling systemwide traffic flow the faa may increasingly rely on traffic management tools to aid strategic and tactical decision making the national playbook is one ex ample of traffic management tool currently implemented to give the faa the ability to deploy specific situationbased tactics for handling capacity constraining c onditions such as adverse weather the national playbook provides the air tra ffic

scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs49 61 federal aviation administration operational evoluti on plan version 60 62 based on faa airport capacity benchmark report 2004 data 63 federal aviation administration airport capacity benchmark report 2001the purpose of the national playbook is to aid the faa and system users in expediting route coordination during the most common scenarios that occur during severe weather the sel ected routes in the national playbook include textual and graphical depictions of specific routing tactics that have been vetted by air traffic control representatives from affected facilities involved in given scenario another operational tool that the faa recently began implementing is the use of express lanes to temporarily increas the flow out of airports experiencing departure delays the concept is that specific levels of delay will trigger the tactical implementation of these express lanes wh this happens air traffic controllers will hold up traffic to and from nearby satellite and reliever airports to allow departures from the major airport to flow more quickly through these express lanes in the sky that open up as result in the future air traffic managers may rely more extensively on these strategies and tactics and rely more heavily on the use of automation and decision aiding tools to optimize airspace utilization and traffic flow management however despite the faas focus on ai r traffic management technologies and methods to improve future airspace utilizati on and increase the efficiency of traffic flow these efforts are not believed to be capable of fully addressing capacity needs by themselves as discussed previously one of the main challenges for meeting aviation capacity needs appears to be linked to the future capability to expand airport infrastructure such as new runways and new airports in major metropolitan areas where demand for air travel is expected to grow significantly over the next 25 years while increased automation and decision ai ding to support air traffic managers controllers and airspace users will help to optimize the utilization of underlying infrastructure experts generally agree that expansion and reconf iguration of airport infrastructure is likely to provide the most substantial gains in available capacity of the national airspace system airport expansion and reconfiguration as the faa notes there are two main strategies for alleviating peak demand at airports building new runways and ma ximizing the use of existing runways61 as indicated from models in the faas cap acity benchmark studies new runways can significantly increase an airports capacity of the twelve oep35 airports building or planning new runways those new runways are expected to net an average capacity improvement of 31 acro ss all weather conditions62 by comparison technology improvements at airports are expected to net more modest capacity increases in the 3 to 8 percent range63 thus any systemwide strategy to enhance capacity is likely to focus heavily on building new runways technology enhancements to improve the usage of existing infrastructure while im portant do not appear to be capable of keeping pace with nearterm growth in airport operations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs50 64 david hughes 2025 squeeze play aviation week space technology november 15 2004 p 4445 65 ibidexpanding capacity at airport level either by adding new runways or by building new airports in metropolita n areas requires extensiv cooperation between the federal government local and state entitie s airport authorities and industry and community stakeholders for this reas on airport expansion plans are often contentious time consuming and challenging the growing need for expanded airport infrastructure throughout the avia tion system is pressuring the faa and airport operators to seek more streamlin ed methods for planning and addressing regulatory compliance issues such as envi ronmental considerations in the planning process partnerships and close coope ration between the faa airport operators state and local governments and stakeholders such as airlines and impacted communities are likely to become more critical in determining the best course of action to expand regional capacity for aviation operations while minimizing environmental impacts and in tegrating proposed soluti ons with other regional transportation objectives as step toward addressing these challenges vison 100 pl 108176 included provisions to strea mline the environmental review process for airport capacity enhancement projects by designating the dot as the lead agency in these assessments and directing the secretary of transportation to develop coordinated review proce ss including simultaneous review by all involved government agencies the objective of th provisions is to reduce the amount of time and number of reviews required for airport expansion projects one major hurdle for many airports in congested areas is available land many airports in major metropolitan areas lack the available land to build on moreover the acquisition of surrounding land to acco mmodate new runways is often not viable option and even when it is doing so is time consuming and resource intensive process that often takes several years some experts believe that one alternative solution is to construct closely spaced pa rallel runways in hopes that technology will be able to provide the capab ility to operate these runways at high capacity levels under most if not all flyable weather conditions64 there are several challenges to doing this probably the most significant challenge is designing runways and taxiways for safe and fficient surface movement between multiple closely spaced parallel runways there are complex operational challenges for handling arrivals that need to taxi across active runways and safety concerns about runway incursions make the use of mu ltiple closely spaced parallel runways particular challenge another significant challenge is the paration requirements imposed to prevent wake turbulence encounters which curren tly limits the capacity of closely spaced runways significantly wingtip vortices produced by heavy jets pose danger to trailing aircraft that presently are dealt with by spacing aircraft several miles apart reducing this separation is an important element of optimizing the usage of closely spaced runways many experts see great promise in ongoing wake vortex research and development at nasas langley research center that may someday lead to the operational deployment of wake turbulence predic tion tool for airports65 however reducing aircraft separation ba sed on the use of such tool in an airport

closely spaced runways can be implemented without compromising safety marketbased options data indicate that at best through ai rport expansion and improvements and through implementation of technology solutions to enhance the capacity of the national airspace system the faa will stru ggle to keep pace with the growth in demand for air travel thus there may be growing need to examine alternative means to alleviate congestion and delay in the aviation system one particular strategy that may be examined is the use of marketbased approaches that in essence alter the demand characteristics of aviation operators in ways designed to make demand for aviation services more commensurate with available capacity in order to maintain efficiency nd safety of operations these marketbased options vary along continuum of government involvement see figure 12 on one end of the continuum ai rlines and other operators could be left to work it out amongst themselves to define market approaches and schedules that will cause minimal delay in some cases there could be limited government involvement in these activities such as ving the faa or dot serve as mediator during discussions of scheduling or as an obs erver to ensure that there is collusion or other violation of antitrust statutes nd regulations and that specific user groups are unfairly disadvantaged in establishing schedules and access to airports the government may take somewhat more active role in such activities by discussing air traffic concerns over proposed schedul options or even suggesting

daily july 15 2004 pp 12another way in which government could exert limited control over scheduling practices is to implement incentives for offpeak scheduling or disincentives for operations during peak hours incentive programs could be accomplished through quota systems for example multiplying landing or takeoff during peak hours by weighting factor when calculating an operators daily or monthly quota of operations at specified airport incentiv programs could also be implemented by increasing or imposing fees such as landi ng fees or atc impact fees during peak hours more direct government involveme nt may involve the use of slot systems where operators and air carriers are llocated limited access to certain congested airports at the other end of the spectru m from government involvement at all over airline scheduling practices is govern ment regulation of the airline industry which was eliminated in 1978 since it is lik ely that any proposal to reregulate the airline industry would face strong oppositi on from both the airlines and consumers such an option is not considered in this discussion of marketbased approaches in the current debate over alleviating congestion at major airports significant policy question that remains is what degr ee of government involvement in airline scheduling and airport access is most likely to provide an appropriate balance between equitable and efficient access to limited airport capacity on the one hand and fair and open competition between air carriers in desirable markets on the other options under consideration to address this issue fall in to two broad categories 1 strategies for curtailing peak hour demand at busy airports through various incentives or disincentives and 2 the use of slot s or quotas to allocate access at capacity constrained airports depeaking strategies and incentives depeaking strategies are designed to alleviate congestion and delay at airports during peak travel times peaking strategies can be implemented with varying degrees of government involvement with minimal level of government involveme nt airlines may negotiate schedules in manner that would reduce delay

the two legacy carriers who have curt ailed operations to complain about losing market share to smaller low cost airlines that are expanding in the chicago market the ongoing frustrations in effectively managing schedule demand at ord highlights the challenges of trying to do so in an equitable fashion that does not impact competition in the market ironically the use of slots at ord was eliminated in 2002 under provisions in air21 pl 106181 the cu rrent scenario at ohare suggests that some government intervention to control schedules at some of the nations busiest airports may be needed in the near future whether this means return to slots or some other form of economic regulation is likely to be an issue of considerable interest to congress despite the ongoing challenges with scheduling at ord there are some examples that suggest that airlines may find some instances where spreading operations out could provide business advantages by reduc ing operating costs for example recent analysis of american ai rlines depeaking efforts at three of its main hubs dallasfort worth dfw chicagoohare ord and miami international mia indicates that spr eading flights out over the day rather than clumping them can improve operational fficiency in reworking its schedule at dfw american reduced daily departures by almost 10 compared to 2000 levels but lost only 11 of available seats67 this analysis indicates that by depeaking operations carriers may be able to increas productivity make more efficient use of gates and consolidate terminal operations thus there appears to be viable business case for depeaking operations in cer tain instances consequently airlines may be quite willing to adopt depeaking stra tegies that could serve mutual benefit to both airline operations as well as faa air traffic operations in cases where there are clear cu t business advantages to depeaking operations and where equitable solutions can be attained by airline industry collaboration and bargaining over flight schedules th federal government and airport operators may look to specific depeaking incentives such as peak hour pricing as means to manage schedule mand few in the airline industry are in favor of such system the air transport association ata trade organization representing major us airlines opposes congestion pricing sc hemes because they argue that these mechanisms siphon off revenues from airlines and put the money in the hands of the airports which are natu ral monopolies and do not have to compete in the highly competitive and price sensitive airline industry68 similarly regional airlines and general aviation operators object to peak hour pricing because theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs54 69 see crs report rs20914 aviation congestion proposed

industry in 1978 slots have been used at few busy airports as method to control airport scheduling under air21 statutory lang uage was enacted phasing out the use of slots largely over concerns that slots coul d preferentially advantage well established carriers and made it difficult for new entrant carriers to gain foothold in certain desirable markets under these provisions the only airport that will continue to have statutorily defined slot sy stem for regulating flight schedules after january 2007 is washington reagan national airport dca however with the phase out of statutory slot systems policymakers will likely face challenges in managing demand to avoid strains on capacity that coul d induce congestion and increased delay it has been reported that the faa is mulling the idea of implementing auctions for slots at new yorks laguardia lga after the statutory slot authorizations expire in january 2007 and possibly at other congested airports like ord71 under such scheme airlines woul d either pay up front fees or monthly leases for slot rights to operate at given airport whether the faa would need statutory authority to carry out such sc heme remains debatable the faa retains the authority to limit flight operations on the basis of safety and could likely implement such scheme so long as it does not treat any airline or operator preferentially in allocating slots however concerns over the potential that the allocation of slots could result in uninte nded market imbalances or may disadvantage service to small communities could prompt congressional oversight or possible legislative action on the issue of airport slot allocations the ata opposes such system largel on the belief that current exceptions and variances for slots such as those th at currently exist for new entrant carriers and for flights serving small communities undermines the purported basis of these schemes for managing operational demand at busy airports and instead melds facets of market controls that directly affect airline business practices on the other hand the airport council international north am erica trade organization representing large airport operators favors slot aucti ons over other schemes such as congestion pricing noting that allocating slots is administratively easier to implement and results in regular predictable schedules with fixed numbers of flights that can be tied directly to available airport capacity in contrast congestion pricing schemes can behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs55 72 ibid difficult to manage and may have little or impact on congestion if it does not correctly predict market factors and demand for peak travel times that may fluctuate based on variety of market factors72 any debate on the issue is likely to rise in significance in the next two years because the slot restrictions at new yorks laguardia lga and kennedy jfk airports are set to expire at the beginni ng of 2007 under the same provisions of air 21 that eliminated slots at ord in 2002 funding challenges status of the airport and airways trust fund one concern over available funding fo r aviation infrastructure enhancements and expansion is the status of the airpor t and airways trust fund aatf the aatf has experienced recent drawdown in fund balances coupled with reduced revenues caused primarily by decline in avia tion ticket tax revenue s from fy2000 through fy2003 both the declining balances nd the loss of revenues are indicators of possible future shortages of funding to pay for capacity enhancement projects figure 13 shows the annual income and uncommitted end of year balances in the aviation trust fund since 1998 modest d ecline in trust fund revenue between 1999 and 2003 is coupled with precipitous decline in uncommitted trust fund balances since 2002 the effects of the economic decline in the aviation industry since 2000 are reflected in this trend from 1999 through 2003 the aviation trust fund experienced about 13 billion dollar decr ease in revenue roughly 12 decline in annual revenues more not able is the continuing dec line in aviation trust funds uncommitted endofyear bala nces which have declined 66 compared to 2001 levels despite recent trust f und revenue increases the tinuing trend of declining trust fund balances is an indicator that costs for modernization efforts are exceeding annual revenues and interest flowing into the trust fund there is also concern that the increasing costs of daytoday operations and the increased reliance on the trust fund for faas operational costs is creating strain on the trust fund this is of particular concern if greater proportion of air traffic operations are expected to be funded directly by the trust fund as the current administration hopes to achieve as opposed to partial funding from the general f und as is currently the case allocations for faa operations between the trust f und and the ge neral fund may become significant policy issue for future ppropriations cycles and the next faa reauthorization trust fund financial projec tions through fy2005 indicate continued declines in trust fund balances along with these declin ing balances updated pr ojections of trust fund revenues through 2007 identify potential revenue shortfall of almost 12 billion compared to preseptembe r 11 2001 revenue projections see table 3 this is despite an expected rebound in revenues starting in fy2004 tied largely to increases in airline ridership however even with increases in airline passenger volume the shift toward low cost carrier s and discounted airfares could reduce thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs56 trust fund income since 75 tax levied on passenger tickets is the largest contributor to trust fund re venue consequently revenue generated as percentage of ticket cost may be lower than in the past despite increased passenger boardings further declines in tax revenue may occur as the result of increased reliance on point topoint service with more pointto point service flyers may fly fewer trip segments thus lowering revenues generated by the per segment tax in recent years the passenger ticket tax and segment tax have comprised more than 60 of total aviation trust fund income thus even with an an ticipated recovery in the airline industry trust fund income may still g due to lowfare compe tition and increased pointto point service however this effect coul d be offset by large growth in passenger boardings if the growth in airline operations can outpace inflation over the next few years it is likely that the trend of decl ining aviation trust f und balances could be reversed source air transport associ ation office of economics airport and airways trust fund cash flow and balance 1971

on commerce science and transportation subcommittee on aviation us senate may 18 2004 while there is still over 2 billion in rese rve in the aviation trust fund the trend of declining trust fund balan ces and revenues may indicate potential shortfalls in the ability to fund future aviation infrastructure projects the status of the trust fund is also impacted by the scope of outlays that it is used to support historically trust fund outlays have been the sole fundi ng source for aviation infrastructure improvements and enhancements to address capacity need s and safety requirements however many view the significant incr ease in use of the trust fund to pay for faas daytoday operations over the past 15 years as potential threat to the availability of funds for faas moderniza tion efforts critics of using trust fund revenues for faas operations account argue that these activities should receive greater percent of funding from the us treasury general fund however others view the aviation system as selfsupportin g entity whose program spending in all areas including operations should be met rgely if not entirely by trust fund revenues therefore one proposal to increase available funds for facilities and equipment upgrades and airpor t improvements is to increase the use of general fund sources for faa operations and perhaps even for capacity enhancement projects since many view aviation as selfs upporting system like highway funding all proposals to increase the general fund share of aviation expenditures are likely to be controversial73 another option albeit highly controve rsial one is to implement feefor service schedule to pay for operational cost s associated with running the national airspace system thus offse tting the strain that these operational costs impose on the aviation trust fund implementation of usag fees for air tra ffic services is one element of concept of privatizing some or all air traffic service functions although user fees are not unique to privatized model of air traffic services and could be imposed in governmentrun system as well usage fees for air traffic services levied on operators would ultimately be borne by ope rators and in the case ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs58 74 why should overtaxed fliers subsid ize private planes editorial usa today april 14 2004 75 phil boyer current system works opinion usa

lines note that with aviation taxes and fees already high despite cost saving measur to trim operational expenses they are unable to absorb additional tax burdens by further reducing operating costs the other difficulty with user fees is the cost and logistical challenge of implementing feeforservice operation and co llecting user fees nonetheless some claim that such an approach would create more equitable system arguing that the current aviation tax and fee structure results in imbalance in which airlines and their passengers pay more than their fair share while business jet operators in particular are able to use the system at only small share of the associated costs74 general aviation lobbyists argue to the contrary that most general aviation users create little impact on the system and pay equitably through taxes levied on aviation fuels75 further complicating the issue is the fact that air traffic services are safetyrelated and as such are in the interest of the general public therefore some argue that some of the costs for these services shoul d be borne by the general public as they currently are this view has especially been highlighted in the aftermath of september 11 2001 where air tra ffic services were seen as playing an important role in national security as well another potential means to make add itional funds available for aviation infrastructure is through increasing trust fund revenue either by increasing aviation taxes destined for the trust fund or by increasing the tax base for the trust fund available options include raising the percent tariff on airfares increasing fixed fees such as the per segment tax or other av iation taxes aviation taxes are obviously contentious issue especially in the curre nt economic climate of the aviation industry the main source of trust fund revenue is the airline passeng er ticket taxes levied at 75 of the fare plus an dditional inflationadjusted f ee charged per flight segment trust fund revenues are also derived from aviation fuel taxes taxes on cargo shipments and international arrival and departure taxes analysis by the ata indicates that taxes and other government fees currently can make up more than 25 of the total cost of typical 200 roundtrip ticket76 by comparison their analysis indicated that taxes and f ees accounted for only 7 of the total ticket cost in 1972 and 15 of the cost in 1992 therefore the airline industry is understandably concerned that increasing revenue for the aviation trust fund by increasing taxes will further destabilize struggling airlines and makes this option extremely contentious implementing any of these options is likely to be unpopular with airlines and aviation consumers as the ata noted taxes and fees imposed on the industry whether on airlines airport or passe ngers ultimately impact the industrys ability to meet consumer demand to grow and produce furt her economic expansion in all sectors of the economy77 therefore policymakers may consider alternatives to increasing taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs59 78 us general accounting office airport financing f unding sources for airport development gaorced9871 march 12 1998 79 federal aviation administration national airspace system op erational evolution plan 20042014 executive summary january 2004 version 60an alternative strategy may be to lower taxes either temporarily or permanently to reduce the tax burden and stimulate growth in the industry while lowering aviation taxes in an effort to increase the tax base is possible option many view this as counterintuitive approach that offers guarantee that shortterm tax revenue losses will be offset in the longterm from the increase in tax base attributable to the tax cut another possible option is to reduce avia tion trust fund outlays in other areas for example trust fund outlays for airpor t construction is appor tioned using formulas based on the airports level of commercial aviation activ ity under the faas airport improvement program aip capacity enhancements ar funded through variety of other sources including airport passeng er facility charges pfcs other airport revenue from the leasing of commercial space and so on state grants and bonds outlays from the aviation trust fund coul d be reduced by altering aip funding formulas thus increasing the reliance on these other funding sources for airport infrastructure improvements however this option may be unpopular because it may further limit the federal role in capacity enhancement projects also large and medium sized airports those most directly affected by capacity constraints are not particularly reliant on aip funds anyway study by the gao found that aip funds covered only 106 of devel opment fundi ng at 71 large and midsized airports compared to 505 of development cost s at other national system airports78 another possible option could be to use general f und resources to pay for faa research and development as opposed to relying on trust fund revenue for these activities advocates for such proposal may argue that research and development activities have the potential to benefit all citizens not just aviation systems users however even if policymakers were to agree nd fund faa research and development from the general fund this would likely have little overall impact on the status of the trust fund because research and developmen t currently accounts for about 130 million annually slightly less than 1 of the total faa budget nearterm projections indicate that aviation trust fund revenues will not keep pace with spending needs for air traffic operations and modernization efforts consequently the faa expects that it will ve considerably less funding to finance new capabilities in its operating budget ther efore the faa is prioritizing programs based on both anticipated capacity gains as well as cost efficiencies and recognizes that it will need to discontinue lowpriority programs79 several elements of the faas facilities nd equipment account the funding source for airspace modernization technologies have been the subject of this prioritizing and cost cutting process faas facilities nd equipment account one potentially contentious issue that reemerged in the fy2005 appropriations process and may be topic of considerable scrutiny in fu ture year budgets is

subcommittee on transportation and related agencies committee on appropriations us senate april 21 1994 gaotrced94195for faas facilitie s and equipment fe account this account pays for capacity enhancement projects related to air traffic control and navigation as seen in figure 14 the fe account has grown over recent years peaking at just under 3 billion in fy2003 figure 14 shows that fe funding has historically followed cyclical trend that appears to be on about 10year cycle such trend is to be expected given that technologies to modernize air tr affic operations take time to mature and go through lengthy development and testing thus surges in funding levels could be expected during periods when these t echnologies reach matur ity and are deployed in large numbers and integrated into the national airspace system the gao noted in 1994 report that fe appropriations rose sharply between fy1982 and fy1985 then declined briefly in fy1986 and fy1987 before increasing sharply again at an inflationadjusted rate of 11 percent annually peaking in 199280 this crescendo in funding during the late 1980s and early 1990s that peaked in 1992 can be tied to work conducted under faas advanced auto mation system aas costly and controversial program to m odernize the faas route and terminal radar control facilities that was to be completed during that time frame the current peak in fy2003 can be tied to the maturation and rollout of two key programs 1 the standard terminal automation replacem ent system stars technology to upgrade the radar consoles in tracon facilities and 2 the commissioning of waas system to improve the accuracy of gps navigation signals therefore given the cyclical nature of fe fundi ng lower funding requests for fy2005 and fy2006 might be expected source appropriations conference reports f aa budget estimates and crs report rs20177 airport and airway trust fund issues in the 106th congress figure 14 faa facilities and equipment fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs61 however the present decrease in fe funding for fy2005 and fy2006 about 12 cut compared to fy2004 levels is seen as somewhat controversial because significant work still needs to be done on communications navigation and air traffic control projects to keep pace with oep targets for the next ten years furthermore the faa faces large funding n eeds if it is to deploy next generation radar sites equip atc facilities with enhanced weather information systems fully deploy stars and move forward with testing and implementation of free flight concepts over the next few years the f aa has cut funding to several lower priority programs particularly communications related programs like nexcom program to provide digital voice and data channels and broaden available very high frequency vhf radio spectrum for air to ground communications and controller pilot data link communications cpdlc tool that will provide text messaging capabilities between pilots and controllers the faa argues that these cuts are reasonable because they are not running out of vhf spectrum as quickly as anticipated and financ ially strapped airlines are not ready to make the necessary investment in cpdlc one major question that may be raised by congress is whether the faa is effectively managing its fe dollars which it has not done good job of in the past as discussed earlier in the section on cost overruns one option to enable future spending on facilities and equipment is to use airport improvement pr ogram aip funds rather than fe funds to pay for airport specific facility acquisitions this has both positive and negative implications for airports on the positive side it can help assure or expedite the acquisition of needed or wanted equipment to enhance capacity or improve safety at an airport on the other hand use of aip funds for equipmen t purchases may take funds away from runway construction or othe r planned capital improvement projects this may result in an increased reliance on local airport funds to keep projects on track if local funds are unavailable or if schedules are llowed to slip for fundingrelated reasons then capital improvements to meet capacity needs may lag behind growth in demand at specific airports also as previously noted with declining balances in the aviation trust fund it may be difficult to meet add itional program funding needs with federal dollars thereby increasing the cost burden on airports besides the cost implications to airports this could also result in imp lementation of fe programs based on local priorities which may not be the same as the federal priorities for enhancing the national airspace system as whole summary of findings this report has identified several factors affecting aviation growth and the ability to meet that growth by enhancing the capability and capacity of the national airspace system below is summary of findings detailed in this report regarding aviation growth capacity needs and factors affecting the faas ability to address these capacity needs aviation capacity needs are geographically specific affecting airports and airspace in several major metropolitan areas and certain high altitude flight corridorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs62 growth trends in aviation operations in major metropolitan regions will continue to strain capacity for the foreseeable future current faa shortterm plans for capacity growth will generally lag slightly behind forecast growth in demand in these capacity constrained regions despite an optimistic longrange vision to triple system capacity fully implementing faas oep will likely only yield about 27 increase in capacity by 2013 as compared to available capacity during the summer of 2000 this projected capacity enhancement will barely keep pace with forecast growth also delays will not be reduced at this level of capacity enhancement since faas forecast model assumes that the prevailin g acceptable level of 14 minutes of average delay is maintained capacity constraints have an impact on system efficiency as measured by delay as well as on system safety as indicated by metrics such as runway incu rsions and operational errors controller staffing shortages and high labor costs for air traffic services may become an impediment to meeting future capacity needs the faa currently does not have strategic plan in place to hire and retain adequate numbers of controllers to replace an aging controller workforce under vision 100 the faa was directed to develop such plan and lang uage in fy2005 appropriations b ills would provide funding to hire and train new controllers meeting future capacity needs will likely require comprehensive systems approach using appropriate options that may include new runways and airport configurati ons additional airports airspace redesign operational tool s and decision aids the use of technologies to increase system throughput and marketbased strategies to alter the demand characteristics of opera tions likely to cause congestion and delay airport improvement projects such as adding runways or reconfiguring taxi routes are seen as one of the most effective ways to alleviate airportspecific congestion and delay however these projects often take many years to plan require buyin from local authorities and may involve ngthy environmental and economic impact assessment processes simila rly airspace redesign can be an effective tool for enhancing syst em capacity but requires lengthy study and evaluation of operati onal and environmental impacts before implementation core technologies to improve syst em throughput such as gps and adsb are generally mature but significant work on complex systems integration is needed to effectively exploit these technologies in manner that will optimize nas capacityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32707crs63 based on past faa program manageme nt efforts that have resulted in cost overruns schedule delays and performance deficiencies in major systems acquisitions systems integration programs to enhance the capacity of the national airspace system are regarded as high risk both the ato and jpdo are too new to assess whether they will be effective in overcoming the orga nizational factors identified as impediments to effective management of nas modernization efforts reduction in aviation trust f und revenues may cause the faa to suspend work or scale back low pr iority programs in the nearterm and search for ways to reduce unit costs for air traffic services by about 21 in the long term c ontinued aviation trust fund revenue shortfalls possible result of lowcost airfares could result in lack of funds for critical capacity enhancement projects however growth in airline
