states is major contributor to relief efforts in international crises and disaster situations key reliefrelated policy issues likely to be of concern in the second session of the 110th congress include budget priorities levels of funding and the types and levels of support available from the international community2 in fy2006 the us government contributed close to 3 billion to disaster relief worldwide3 congress has consistently supported humanitarian efforts as means of responding to natural disasters such as floods earthquakes and manmade crises such as war in the short term taking the lead and promoting us presence4 humanitarian assistance generally receives bipartisan congressional support congress has given the president broad authority in this area the foreign assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 as amended authorizes the united states to participate in disaster relief efforts and gives the president great flexibility to respond to disasters with wide range of governmentfunded humanitarian assistance 5 in 1993 president clinton designated for the first time the administrator of the us agency for international development usaid as the special coordinator for international disaster assistance6 in this capacity the administrator coordinates the us governments response to both natural or manmade disasters the administrator also calls upon federal agencies to provide assistance contracts with and funds private voluntary agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and coordinates the us response with that of other countries7

in order to save lives and provide reliefhas resulted in broad definition of humanitarian assistance on both policy and operational level while humanitarian assistance is assumed to address urgent food shelter and medical needs the agencies within the us government providing this support expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances 1 this report draws on an earlier report on the same topic now out of print by lois mchugh 2 these key policy issues may be applied in the global context but also in the us response to specific crises of concern to congress 3 due to the unanticipated nature of many disasters humanitarian aid budget allocations often increase throughout the year as demands arise countries that have or are experiencing crisis or natural disaster r eceive us aid through several key worldwide emergency humanitarian assistance accounts for disaster international disaster and famine assistance or idfa food relief pl 480 title ii and refugee programs emergency refugee migration assistance or erma these accounts are generally used to respond to emergency situations and are not integrated into longterm development strategies 4 us private contributions and efforts are also part of the overall response but not addressed in this report 5 sec 491493 of pl 87195 foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended 6 sec 493 of pl 87195 foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended 7 ambassador randall l tobias was nominated by president bush in january 2006 to serve concurrently as the administrator of usaid and the first director of foreign

the decision on the type of assistance required to the president us humanitarian assistance in disasters and international crises is broad far reaching and covers many ements directly concerned with the provision of relief and strategies for strengthening how people survive over time8 congress broadly defines humanitarian activities in an effort to enable the us response to be as flexible as possible to adapt to humanitarian needs assistance can include the provision of basic needs child survival strategies and assistance to refugees but in practice the provision of humanitarian assistance is typically case and time specific 9 g7g161g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g10g158g150g138g151g146g157g138g155g146g138g151g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561 in general humanitarian assistance is exempt from the regulations implementing various types of foreign aid sanctions10 the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended pl 87195 allows the president to provide disaster assistance notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other act which would otherwise prohibit or restrict aid to selected countries such as economic sanctions

operations has spent unprecedented amounts on global humanitarian emergencies particularly in the last decade the confluence of several natural disastershurricane mitch which struck central america in late 1998 the drought in ethiopia and elsewhere in africa since 2002 the indian ocean tsunami which struck in december 2004 and the october 2005 earthquake in pakistanplus continuing conflicts around the worldkosovo 1999 liberia until 2003 afghanistan 2002 prewar iraq 2003 haiti 2004 and darfur since 2003combined to push foreign aid spending on humanitarian crises to their highest levels in three decades 12 the 8 livelihood strategy considers the specific context and circumstances of the situation in designing effective programs that work with local abilities to cope with emergencies 9 what is less clear is when an activity might be considered humanitarian as differentiate d from postconflict transition or reconstruction and to what degree this distinction need s to remain flexible to adapt to changes in policy or operations on the ground in an operational sense humanitarian and other assistance is often provided on parallel tracks and there is usually an overlap in activities in the transition from one phase to another 10 the decision as to what is considered humanitarian versus nonhumanitarian is often made on casebycase basis for example in the indiapakistan situation in 1998 sanctions were applied following indias nuclear tests under the pressler amendment all aid was cut off except for specific relief assistance programs 11 while there is official definition of what constitutes us humanitarian assistance for the purposes of trend analysis this discussion is based on spending appropriated in the current foreign operations and agriculture accounts for international disaster and famine assistance transition initiatives migration and refugee assistance emergency migration and refugee assistance fund and title ii of pl 480 food assistance in addition in selected years congress created special accounts for specific relief efforts such as the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund 2005 and central america and the caribbean emergency fund 1999 figures do not include amounts funded outside the foreign affairs budget function 150 such as the defense departments overseas humanitarian disaster and civic action account provided in an nual dod appropriations ie the 151 budget account data are expressed in fy2006 dollars taking in the effects of inflation over time this section is based on crs report rl33262 foreign policy budget trends thirtyyear review and

the late 1970s and slightly higher than the 373 billion funding level for fy2005 resources for fy2006 3 billion are lower than the recent peak years although they remain one of the largest totals over the past 30 years in this 30year review there were only two instances where humanitarian aid funding levels come close to recent totals for fy1980fy1981 large supplementals for indochina and sovieteast european refugee resettlements brought amounts to around 28 billion in fy1985 humanitarian relief spending exceeded 275 billion largely due to substantial us response to major famine in africa assistance to populations affected by the gulf war in 1991 and to victims of conflict in bosnia haiti and rwanda in 1994 represented other surge years for humanitarian aid budgets 13 continued be ongoing for several of these cases 13 it should be noted that comparisons across disasters may be helpful in general terms but the data cannot illustrate fully the complexities of each situation the disasters them selves are not equivalent the areas in which they occur differ dramatically in terrain underlying economic conditions and governmental capacity each us agency has its own budget with its own criteria accounting detail and regional specificity budgets may reflect regional support certain area specific countries or combination thereof over time and with changing events authority definitions and categories of services are not necessarily equivalent across events the fact that an urgent response to humanitarian crises is often required only compounds the problem of tracking humanitarian aid funding levels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33769 g561 g5g20g21g556g346g561key trends due to the unforeseen and unpredictable nature of events requiring humanitarian relief spending patterns have been highly erratic over the past 30 years in general however resources committed for food disaster and refugee support have been growing for the past two decades amounts have been especially large in several years since fy1999 fy2006 appropriations for humanitarian aid programs at 3 billion fell below recent years fy1999 fy2003 and fy2005 for the entire 30year period

measures slowing or reducing discretionary spending or finding the resources to sustain us aid pledges may be difficult after the 2004 tsunami disaster some members of congress publicly expressed concern that funding for tsunami relief and reconstruction which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency accounts could jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid had been transferred 27 these accounts were fully restored through supplemental appropriations at the time others noted the substantial size of american private donations for tsunami victims and argued that because of other budget pressures the united states government did not need to transfer additional aid beyond what was already pledged the point remains however that when disasters require immediate emergency relief the administration may fund pledges by depleting most worldwide disaster accounts in order to respond to future humanitarian crises however these resources would need to be replenished if not replenished us capacity to respond to other emergencies could be curtailed

disaster assistance28 it is not always evident whether figures listing donor amounts represent pledges of support or more specific obligations29 pledges made by governments do not always result in actual contributionsthe earthquake of december 200 3 in bam iran is but one example used by the united nations billions of dollars were pledged to help the victims of the 2004 tsunami disaster in the indian ocean but there is skepticism over whether all these pledges will ever be honored it also cannot be assumed that the funds committed to relief actually represent new contributions since the money may previously have been allocated elsewhere it also takes time for more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of disaster will be shared among international donors comparing usg and international aid is also difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the assistance takes inkind contributions vs cash for instance finding balance between burdensharing on the one hand and donor fatigue on the other often results in delay and can negatively impact relief operations during emergencies when immediate funds are required for response some experts are concerned about funding priorities and the ongoing need for resources for other disaster areas 27 elizabeth becker new funds needed for relief bush aides say new york times january 4 2005 28 although the united states is the worlds largest provider of overall foreign assistance which includes humanitarian assistance in absolute terms it is often one of the lowest contributors among developed countries when measured as percentage of its economic capacity according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states provided 016 of its gross national income gni in 2004 for overseas disaster assistance oda by comparison the average of major donors is 025 the percentages for other major donors are as follows japan 019 the united kingdom 036 france 042 and germany 028 29 relief web is good source of information although the accuracy is not guaranteed see httpwwwreliefwebint obtaining an exact uptodate record of all international contributions in response to an ongoing disaster is often not possiblein part because some assistance is not reported to governments or coordinating agenciesand in part because of the delay in their recording

the central emergency response fund cerf30 as part of the united nations reform process in march 2006 the cerf was launched based on several earlier resolutions approved by the general assembly to strengthen the united nations capacity to respond to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies31 as an international multilateral funding mechanism th cerf aims to focus on early intervention timely response and increased capacity and support to underfunded crises the cerf will have grant facility of up to 450 million and loan facility of up to 50 million the funds come from voluntary contributions by member states and from the private sector32 the cerf is seen by proponents as way to enable the united nations to respond more efficiently effectively and consistently to humanitarian crises worldwide others also believe that us support for this idea is critical to sustaining momentum for donor contributions and continued support for the disaster relief fund

allocation of monies and monitoring of projects by the united nations the united nations is improving its financial tracking and reporting system in responding to international disasters many contributions are also made directly to ios and ngos which could raise the same questions about transparency requirements moreover while earmarks and time limits may ensure greater accountability they can also add pressure for organizations to spend contributed funds sometimes leading to unnecessary spending waste and duplicated efforts restrictions on use of funds also often do not allow flexibility to adapt projects to better meet the changing needs on the ground 33

also raises the potential for unexpected consequences first it is important to examine whether humanitari an assistance is going to those for whom it is intended evaluating and tracking provision of supplies is difficult during conflict and impossible to completely control second there is the role of the ngo including its mission and sources of funding in what has become major independent enterprise in conflict areas there is the potential for misuse intended or unintended which may require closer analysis of the performance of providers third the safety and protection of refugees idps and humanitarian workers is another important issue growing number of humanitarian workers in various parts of the world have been put at great risk or lost their lives in providing humanitarian assistance 30 this fund should not be confused with the commanders emergency response fund or cerp this is program initiated by dod that allows commanders in the field to pr ovide resources

protects humanitarian relief workers and parties to the conflict will have some bearing on who is in charge the security measures taken and provided and the perception of whether the humanitarian community has taken sides in the conflict fourth there is the question raised by some experts as to whether the provision of humanitarian assistance is helpfulparticularly in cases where there is consensus on how or when to intervene but only on the need to demonstrate action some question whether humanitarian assistance in some instances actually prolongs conflict g14g146g151g148g156g561g157g152g561g4g155g152g138g141g142g155g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g9g152g138g149g156g561 political considerations play role in the way assistance is given and to whom the images of human suffering portrayed by the media only rein force the need to do something humanitarian assistance carries some weight as an instrument of neutral intervention in crisis and is the most flexible policy tool that can be quickly brought to bear in crisis it can buy time and keep options opens and may be an avenue to achieve minimal consensus sometimes the easiest decision in terms of finding path of least resistance humanitarian assistance can also expand beyond its immediate function it may provide the means to maintain some form of contact with countryregion or mitigate tensions over policy towards region within the us government or with and among its allies humanitarian assistance often means doing something to avert crisis to provide support to allies and to maintain presence in the region how it is used and whether it becomes more of strategic policy tool depends upon the situation what other governments are doing and the degree to which the united states has further interest in the region in addition it raises questions about implications for future action on the one hand if the united states decides to reduce its humanitarian support would this diminish its standing among its allies or affect its interests in other ways on the other hand since the president has great deal of flexibility over us involvement once commitmen t to humanitarian effort is made does this make the longterm us participation in reconstruction and political solutions more likely regardless it is clear that as crises proliferate the level and sources of us humanitarian assistance will inevitably have an important impact not only on the relief operation itself but on broader foreign policy goals
