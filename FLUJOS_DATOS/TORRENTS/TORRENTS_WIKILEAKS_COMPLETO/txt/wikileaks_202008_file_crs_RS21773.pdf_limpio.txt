transport services in africa to fly medical personnel supplies and antire tro viral therapies to rural areas on regular schedule it is estimated that at least 2 million women and girls suffer from this affliction worldwide fistula occurs from prolonged bor particularly when labor lasts two days or more when woman or girl is unable to push the baby out the pressure from the babys head can interrupt blood flow to ssues in the pelvic area ultimately the woman passes the baby after it dies as the decomposed body is smaller than the live one after pushing for number of days hole develops in the tissue between the vagina and bladder and at times the rectum causing incontinence fistula survivors can also suffer nerve damage which can make walking difficult women with this condition are stigmatized and usually shunne d due to their strong odor some are abandoned by their husbands on whom they are financially depe ndent and are forced to leave their homes many live life of solitude those who are cast out often resort to begging and in some cases sex work this report will discuss the prevalence of this condition the impact that the condition has on affected girls and women and describe efforts of usaid and other organizations to raise awareness prevent and treat fistula obstetric fistula occurs almost exclusively in veloping countries mostly because women in the most

httpwwwfistulahospitalorgarticlehtmlunderfunded as result many women deliver at home without skilled birth attendants increasing their risk fo r developing fistula this affliction occurs most often among girls aged 1519 years old whose pelvises have not finished growing in many rural areas girls are married just after they experience their first menstrual flow usually between the ages of 10 and 15 years1 the young girls who are affected are also often poor and malnour ished the girls pelvic size can also be small due to malnourishment which can cause stunting the combination of youth and stunting makes young girls more vulnerable to the condition for example in niger 80 of fistula cases occurred am ong girls aged 1519 years2 it is unknown exactly how many develop fist ula because many women labor outside of facilities and many countries do not reco rd cases the world health organization who estimates that at least 2 million girls and women are living with fistula and that an additional 50000 to 100000 are affected each year however the united nations population fund unfpa be lieves the estimate is too low because it c ounts only patients who seek treatment3 the uncounted include the many women in affected countries who do not have access to medical cen ters and must walk up to three days to the nearest facility other estimates seem to support unfpas assertion the nigerian ministry of womens affa irs estimates that some 800000 women await treatment while some 8500 ethiopian women are believe d to develop the condition annually4 fistula repair and prevention are difficult to secure in many developing countries for number of reasons first cost can be prohibitive factor additionally many health centers in the most affected areas subsa haran africa and south asia lack funding trained professionals basic equipment and rgical supplies to conduct the repair surgery furthermore the expense and shortage of skilled birth attendant s and minimal access to cesarean section further complicate fforts to prevent obstetric fistula us and international response some organizations work to prevent and repair obstetric fistula which is largely unknown in the

international campaign against fistula which began in july 2001 one of the first outcomes of their campaign has been the release of report documenting how health care facilities cared for women with fistula in nine countries in subsaharan africa the report was the first survey documenting the ability of local facilities to respond to fistula needs across the region the consortium plans to continue its res earch and report on the breadth of cases in other african countries and south asia alt hough researchers visited nine countries they were unable to estimate the actual number of women affected as fistula is rarely recorded in provider logs and information on preval ence has never been compiled one reason researchers found is that fistula repair is seen as luxury surgery given that the woman will not die without the surgery additiona lly researchers found that many women did not know that treatment was available for example in chad one hospital reported that it conducted twentyfour fistula surgeries per year however within one week of launching an awareness campa ign which announced that fistula repair surgery would be conducted seventy women requested treatment5 unfpa also supports existing fistula treatment centers in ethiopia nigeria and tanzania as well as the development of new ones in ghana and uganda one unfpa supported center the hamlin fistula hospita

national hospital in kenya and lira district hospital in uganda key challenges cultural barriers it has been argued that postponing marriage and ultimately pregnancy would decrease incidence of obstetric fistula however in many countries girl is eligible for marriage once she menstruates marriage is not only celebratory cultural practice but it also has economic implications in many rural societies the practice of paying bride price remains common in many parts of the worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21773crs5 8 world economic forum african food security role fo r publicprivate

the bride receives compensation for girl upon marriage most often in the form of money cattle or other prized resources the family that weds the girl benefits by gaining food producer girls and women are particularly important in traditional agrarian societies especially in africa where 80 of subsistence farmers are women8 additionally the family gains one who can increase the size of the family through procreation in areas that have bride price traditi on girl may be viewed as an additional financial burden when family postpones her marriage concurrently if young girl postpones pregnancy then there is less support in laborheavy agricultural work consequently critics argue th at convincing people in agri cultural societies to delay marriage and pregnancy would be signifi cant educational exerci and would require cultural change with considerable economic impacts local capacity obstetric fistula repair surgery requires trained medical staff and surgical equipment both of which are difficult to secure in limitedresource settings many developing countries face significant brain drain challenges the few medical professionals who are welltrai ned are often attracted by higher salaries and better working conditions in other countries for ex ample it is estimated that between onethird and onehalf of all south african medical sc hool graduates emigrate to the developed world costing the country an estimated 184000 per professional paradoxically it is estimated that africa spends about 4 billion per year on the salaries of 100000 foreign experts9 the movement of skilled health professiona ls to other countries or private clinics exacerbates medical staff shor tages due to other causes such as limited specialized medical and educational facilities and the inability of many to pay for advanced training analysts point out that it is difficult fo r countries with struggling health care infrastructures to prioritize treating obstetric fistula when they struggle to offer basic health care number of countries struggle to maintain an inventory of such basic supplies as latex gloves hypode rmic needles and anesthes ia while in highincome countries an average of 8 of national income is spent on health 1000 to 4000 per capita lowincome countries spend between 1 to 3 of gdp for health the latter may only be between 2 to 50 per capita thus even with significant increases in health care spending only rudimentary health care woul d be available for the general population10 sustainable funding fistula repair costs between 100 and 400 an affordable cost for most in industrialized countries howe ver in many of the most affected countries the cost of the surgery exceeds annual family income thus women and girls who suffer from fistula will most likely rely on international programs that offer repair surgery critics argue that this is not sustainable solution it has been said that more funds should be spent on building health infrastructur

care to the millions of women affected by obstetric fistula limited local expertise on fistula repair also inhibits the ability to res pond to the need observers emphasize that the reliance on foreign surgeons for fistula repair surgery increases the related costs and minimizes the number of women and girls who can be helped critics point to the 1 million appropriation to the international medical corps they argue that while the funds will serv to increase the number of women able to receive assistance only limited number of wome n will be helped due to the relatively high salaries of foreign doctors and othe r related expenses thus some advocate increased funding for building local capacity other reproductive health programs proponents argue that support for other programs that impact womens health need greater funding some point to small increases in usaid family planning and reproductive health spending since fy1999 usaid received 381 million in funding for its family planning nd reproductive health programs in fy1999 which by fy2004 had increased by 655 million to 4465 million similarly funds for child survival nd maternal health programs rose by 18 million from 312 million in fy1999 to 330 million in fy2004 some are concerned that support for hivaids programs ve overshadowed critical challenges in reproductive and maternal health care globally usaid spending on hivaids rose from 139 million in fy1999 to 5165 million in fy2004 an increase of 3775 million proponents argue that increases in maternal and reproductive health funding should parallel those of hivaids prog rams as advances in those fields are inextricably linked to the prevention of the virus the president of engenderhealth nongove rnmental organization that focuses on womens health worldwide recently stated at congressional briefing that the women who face high maternal morbidity rates uni ntended pregnancies fistula and other maternal health complications are the same women who are likely to contract hiv11 recent study undertaken in kenya demonstrat ed that reproductive health and hivaids funding often have an invers relationship the study found that spending for population and family planning fell from 12 million in 1995 to 6 million in 2001 while funding for hivaids programs rose from 2 million in 1995 to nearly 12 million in 200112 it has been argued that increasing hivaids spending while maintaining or reducing support for maternity health and health care infra structures risks seeing rise in fistula maternal morbidity and range of other re productive health problems some argue that family planning maternal health and reproductive hea lth care programs should be integrated into hivaids programs
