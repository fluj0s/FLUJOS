procedures hong kongs chief executive must submit report justifying its need3 the initial responses to the npcscs decision both within hong kong and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787 internationally were varied both in their interpretations of the content of the decision and the implications for democratization in hong kong tsang welcomed the decision as clear timetable for democratization opinions from hong kongs various political parties ranged from strong approval to strong disappointment us and uk government representatives gave the decision more mixed review while taiwanese officials considered the decision more proof that one country two systems model would not work for taiwan details of the decision in part the differences in the response to the npcscs decision may be attributed to the perceived ambiguity of its wording which allows for differing interpretations of its content however the apparent ambiguity of the decisions wording might also be the result of the npcscs efforts to abide by the technical legal aspects of the issues addressed by the decision portions of the decision are unequivocal the first sentence of the first section of the decision clearly prohibits the election of the chief executive by universal suffrage in 2012 and the second sentence clearly prohibits the election of legco by universal suffrage in 20124 the second sentence also prohibits altering the 5050 split in the legco between 2 official english translation of the decision is available at httpnewsxinhuanetcomenglish 20071229content_7334596htm 3 the full text of the

as shall not be implemented by the method of universal suffrage crs3 members elected by geographic regions and members selected by functional constituencies in the 2012 election5 other portions of the decision are more open to interpretation regarding both the chief executive and legco elections of 2012 the decision states that appropriate amendments may be emphasis added made to the specific method of selection however the original chinese keyi zuo chu shidang xiugai could be construed either as the npcsc granting hong kong permission to make appropriate amendments or that hong kong may propose appropriate amendments without implying that the amendments would be necessarily accepted by the npcsc similarly regarding the chief executive election of 2017 and subsequent legco elections the decision states it may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage keyi shixing you puxuan chansheng banfa but the language is subject to the same ambiguity of interpretation between the granting of permission or the statement of possibility regardless of ones interpretation of these phrases the decision does provide clear statement of how election changes are to be made amending the election process involves sixstep process6 first the chief executive shall make report chu httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787 baogao to the npcsc on the need for amendment of hong kongs election process

lingyu member of hong kongs civil human rights front chrf8 beijing only tries to play with words to cheat hong kong people there has not been any promise that we can have universal suffrage in 20179

kong tam yiuchung chairman of the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong dab said that in light of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787 npcscs decision the focus should be on how the functional constituencies could work with universal suffrage12 however yeung sam current legco member from the democratic party disagreed stating that the functional constituencies were incompatible with universal suffrage13 liberal party chairman james tien peichun took broader view of the decision stating matter how you see it you should try your best to ensure hong kongs three millionodd registered voters have chance to elect the chief executive in 201714 public opinion polls taken after the announcement of the decision have revealed generally positive response telephonebased poll of

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787 elections in 2012 disappointment to all but then noted that the npcs statement clearly points towards universal suffrage for the chief executive election in 2017 and the legislative council election thereafter20 taiwanese officials were more critical of the npcscs decision tung chenyuan member of taiwans mainland affairs council stated that the decision indicated that the chinese communist party does not allow genuine democracy and demonstrated that the one country two systems policy would not be accepted by the people of taiwan21 critical issues in light of the npcscs decision hong kongs advancement towards democracy faces three critical issues first the status of legcos functional constituencies will need to be resolved some hong kong politicians and analysts maintain that the functional constituencies are incompatible with the concept of universal suffrage and they will eventually have to be eliminated other hong kong politicians and analysts as well as the npcsc hold that functional constituencies are not irreconcilable with universal suffrage and that they represent sectors of the community which are considered important 15 survey results

told tsang npc warn movement must be made in next 5 years south china morning post december 30 2007 21 ibid crs6 to hong kongs economic stability and development wide range of proposals have already been offered on how to handle the functional constituencies including changing the number of functional constituencies and altering their voter eligibility requirements so that every hong kong voter could vote for at least one functional constituency legco member but finding suitable compromise may prove to be difficult second the composition of the nominating committee for the chief executive and the requirements necessary to officially be nominated are possibly the greatest challenges facing the direct election of the chief executive currently to be nominated person must receive the support of at least 100 of the 800 members of the largely appointed election committee there have been calls to increase the number of members on the committee by including more people and in particular the elected members of hong kongs district councils however adding more people to the committee would either increase the possible number of nominees assuming the 100 votes requirement was kept or would necessitate changing the number of votes required to be nominated third possibly the greatest challenge will be finding proposed set of amendments for the elections in 2012 and 2017 that will receive the support of at least twothirds of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787 legco proposal in 2005 to amend the election process for the 2007 chief executive election and the 2008 legco election failed when coalition of the various pro democracy parties and the liberal party voted against the proposed amendments because they were seen as being too modest22 in 2008 and beyond the hong kong government will need to develop proposed legislation that provides enough democracy to obtain support from sufficient number of legco members associated with the parties that opposed the 2005 proposal without losing too many legco members associated with parties such as dab that supported the 2005 proposal implications for congress support for the democratization of hong kong has been an element of us foreign policy for over 15 years the hong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 states support for democratization is fundamental principle of united states foreign policy as such it naturally applies to united states policy toward hong kong this will remain equally true after june 30 1997 congress might act to assist hong kongs progress towards universal suffrage and democracy by closely monitoring the development of appropriate amendments to the 2012 election process for both the chief executive and legco congress might also encourage the state department to provide greater assistance to its democracypromotion efforts in hong kong in fy2006 the state departments human rights and democracy fund allocated 450000 to project in hong kong designed to strengthen political parties and civil society organizations23 in addition congress could opt to pursue greater contact with legco via provisions set out in section 105 of the ushong kong policy 22 for more detailed analysis of the 2005 proposal see carrie lai and christine loh from nowhere to nowhere civic exchange 2007 23 fy2007 figures unavailable under pl 110161 congress has appropriated 15 million for democracy and rule of law programs in the peoples republic of china hong kong and taiwan specific amount was allocated to hong kong crs7 act finally congress could include language in suitable legislation to reactivate the section 301 provision of the ushong kong policy act that requires an annual report from the state department to congress on the status of hong kong
