outlays does not itself imply that entitlement programs in general and health entitlements in particular are unaffordable for the federal government on the one hand to the extent that change represents public priorities for the use of government resources it might be both appropriate and desirable to dedicate growing share of federal spe nding to medicare and medicaid on the other hand if health care costs c ontinue to grow faster than the economy growth in spending for medicare and medicaid is expected to lead to growing gap between federal spending and federal revenues absent si gnificant changes in spending policy revenue policy or bot h growing annual deficits will increase federal debt which in turn could harm the economy3 tax expenditures for health in surance and health care expenses in addition to spending for medicare medicaid nd other health programs tax subsidies for health insurance and health care expenses affect the federal budget outlook by reducing revenue from persona l income taxes by far the largest healthrelated tax expenditure is for employerprovided health benefits according to estimates from th joint committee on taxation jct because such benefits are excluded from federal income and employment taxes tax receipts were 106 billion lower in fy2007 that they would have been otherwise4 other healthrelated tax expenditures include the itemized deduc tion for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses above 75 of adjusted gross income the deduction for health insurance for the selfemployed and the deduction and ex clusion for health savings accounts5 public and private spending on health care in calendar year 2006 national health expenditures nhe were 21 trillion see table 2 6 of this amount just over 11 trillion in spending came
