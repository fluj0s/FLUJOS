by firms across national borders has become prominent feature of the us economy and that through direct investment the us economy has become highly enmeshed with the broader global economy this also means that the united states has important economic political and social interests at stake in the development of international policies regarding direct investment with some exceptions for national security the united states has established domestic policies that treat foreign investors less favorably than us firms the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 spurred some members of congress and others to call for reexamination of elements of the traditionally open environment in the united states for foreign investment in particular some members argue that greater consideration must be given to the longterm imp act of foreign direct investment on the structure and the industrial capacity of the economy and on the ability of the economy to meet the needs of us defense and security interests in addition policymakers from broad group of nations are evaluating their national policies concerning foreign investment within the context of their national security concerns as result of these initiatives members of congress may be pressed to address us policies that focus on the role of foreign direct investment more extensively within broader national security framework this report assesses recent international developments as the leaders from number of nations work to reach consensus on an informal set of best practices regarding national restrictions on foreign investment for national security purposes this report also provides one possible approach for assessing the costs and benefits involved in using national policies to direct or to restrict

g343g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 for more than half century the united states has led international efforts to reduce restrictions on foreign investment in part these efforts are related to general commitment to open markets and to the free flow of international capital as an important component in economic development at the same time the united states is the largest foreign direct investor in the world and also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment by yearend 2007 foreign direct investment in the united states had reached 21 trillion and us direct investment abroad had reached 28 trillion this dual role means that globalization or the spread of economic activity by firms across national borders has become prominent feature of the us economy and that through direct investment the us economy has become highly enmeshed with the broader global economy the globalization of the economy also means that the united states has important economic political and social interests at stake in the development of international policies regarding direct investment with some exceptions for national security 1 the united states has established domestic policies that treat foreign investors less favorably than us firms in addition the united states has led efforts over the past 50 years to negotiate internationally for reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment for greater controls over incentives offered to foreign investors and for equal treatment under law of foreign and domestic investors in light of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 however some members of congress are reexamining some elements of this opendoor policy and are arguing for greater consideration of the longterm impact of foreign direct investment especially where that investment takes the form of an acquisition merger or takeover of an existing us company in particular these concerns have centered around the impact of such investments on the structure and the industrial capacity of the economy and on the ability of the economy to meet the needs of us defense and security interests including terrorist attack as result of these concerns in 2007 congress changed the way foreign direct investments are reviewed through pl 11049 the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 2 through pl 11049 congress strengthened its role in reviewing foreign investments by enhancing its oversight capabilities there is precise way however to estimate the exact dollar amount for the economic costs and benefits of national policies that attempt to direct or restrict foreign direct investment for national security concerns also there is way to determine if foreign investment policies are implemented to enhance national security or to engage in form of economic protectionism in some cases other policy tools may well be preferred to intervening in the foreign investment process 1 crs report rl33103 foreign investment in the united states major federal statutory restrictions by michael v seitzinger 2 pl 11049 originated in the first session of the 110th congress as s 1610 the foreign investment and

sales employment and growth in assets from 2000 to 2003 but global foreign direct investment flows picked up in the 20042007 period as indicated in table 1 in 2005 2006 and 2007 global direct investment flows grew by 27 38 and 18 respectively to reach 15 trillion the rise in global direct investment flows was driven by an increase in corporate profits worldwide and resulting higher stock prices that raised the value of crossborder mergers and acquisitions the developed economies continue to absorb about two thirds of global direct investment flows with the developing economies sharing the rest africa continues to receive the smallest share generally less than 3 with latin america receiving about 8 and asia getting between 18 and 22 the united nations estimates that foreign direct investment should remain strong through 2009 8 recent study on investment trends by the organization for economic cooperation and developm ent oecd reports that direct investment outflows reached record 18 trillion in 2007 in part due the decline in the value of the dollar relative to the euro which results in an upward valuation in dollar terms in investments that originally had been priced in euros the oecd projects that the overall amount of direct investment flows in 2008 will decline as result of lower levels of foreign direct investment into and out of the united states9 7 world

to reduce official government restrictions on foreign investment one prominent exclusion to these efforts and to commitments incorporated in international treaties is the right of nations to protect their own essential security interests the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 combined with the growing role of statebacked investors or sovereign wealth funds swfs 10 has spurred number of nations to reconsider their national security interests relative to inward investment and to consider placing additional restrictions on foreign investments in areas considered to be an essential security interest11 for the most part such restrictions apply to mergers acquisitions and takeovers of existing firms and not generally to new establishments these actions in turn have raised concerns among the members of such organizations as the oecd12 which promotes the concept of liberalized government restrictions on the free flow of international investment 10 for additional information see

world to foreign direct investment the united states has led efforts to negotiate internationally for reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment for greater rules on incentives offered to foreign investors and for equal treatment under law of foreign and domestic investors in particular the united states has supported efforts within the oecd to develop such legally nonbinding arrangem ents as the oecd code of liberalization of capital movements covering both longand shor tterm capital movements and the code of liberalization of current invisible operations covering crossborder trade in services in addition the oecd has issued basic statement on foreign investment the declaration on international investment and multinational enterprises which is general statement of policy regarding the rights and responsibilities of foreign investors the united states and other signatories to the oecd arrangements recognize that one notable exception to the open investment policies provided for in the oecd instruments as well as in customary international law is that governments can take measures they consider necessary to protect essential security interests and to maintain public order or the protection of public health morals and safety such an exception has been recognized in various international agreements in countless bilateral investment treaties and in investment chapters of free trade agreements according to the oecd the right to protect essential security interests of the state as an exception to treaty commitments has been well established in treaty practice 13 another aspect of this policy is that each state is best situated to assess its own security interests and to decide whether essential security interests are at stake relative to certain types of investments under customary international law the argument of necessity has been interpreted to mean an incident that poses grave and imminent peril to country or threat to such vital interests as political or economic survival the continued functioning of its essential services the maintenance of internal peace the survival of sector of its population and the preservation of the environment of its territory 14 various agreements including multilateral agreements and oecd investment instruments acknowledge th at each nation has the exclusive role of determining for itself whether restriction on foreign investment is necessary to protect its essential security interests as governments move to assess their national policies on foreign investments they are faced with tradeoff between their desires to preserve and expand an open international investment environment with the national responsibility to sa feguard essential security interests this trade off is complicated further by the nature of the threats that are associated with mergers acquisitions and takeovers of existing firms such investments generally are not viewed as posing an immediate threat to the stability or s ecurity of nation some observers however view some of these investments as posing potential threats to the economy in the form of loss of technology related to national security loss of jobs due to outsourcing or threat associated with statebacked investors who use their investme nts to advance political objectives as result policies directed at reviewing foreign direct investments are best described as precautionary 13 international investment perspectives freedom of investment in changing world 207 edition organization for economic cooperation and development 2007

national security threats posed by mergers acquisition or takeovers do not include overt acts of transnational terrorism that are meant to dissuade foreign capital inflows16 the oecd reports that number of governments have started to review their policies on inward foreign investment in response to changing context for national security and the increasing prominence of new investors incl uding large investors controlled by foreign governments17 from france and germany the united states and canada to various nonoecd countries existing regulatory regimes have been used to deter certain investments in infrastructure for national security concerns or countries have tightened their regulations on security grounds18 due to the increased attention focused on the national security aspects of inward foreign investment the oecd formed in june 2006 the f reedom of investment national security and strategic industries project through the eight rounds of meetings including the latest one held in october 2008 members19 of the investment project have agreed to support three principles for national investment policy measures that address essential security interests 1 transparency and predictability20 2 proportionality21 and 3 accountability proportionality refers to the concept that restrictions on foreign investment should be greater than is needed to protect national security in june 2007 at the annual summit of the group of eight22 g8 leading industrialized nations the group issued declaration on freedom of investment environment and social responsibility the final summit statement also emphasized the groups continuing support for the oecd project on freedom of investment national security and strategic industries the g8 statement also offered its support for free flow of investment by indicating that we will work together to strengthen open and transparent investment regimes and to fight against tendencies to restrict them erecting barriers and supporting protectionism would result in loss of prosperity we therefore agree on the central role of free and open markets to facilitate global capital movements we reaffirm that freedom of investment is crucial pillar of economic growth prosperity and employmentagainst this background we remain committed to minimize any national restrictions on foreign investment such restrictions should apply to very limited cases which primarily concern national security the general principles to be followed in such cases are nondiscrimination transparency and 15 friedman benjamin h the terrible ifs

three principles while it is too early to tell nations including the united states may choose to adjust their national laws to have them conform to the recommendations of the oecds final report the oecd members also have agreed to adopt set of 14 guidelines that are meant to serve as the basis for establishing investment policy measures these guidelines are designed to assist nations in adopting investment measures that safeguard national security and are consistent with the three principles of transparency proportionality and accountability these measures are nondiscrimination governments should treat similarly situated foreign and domestic investments in similar fashion transparencypredictability regulatory practices should be as transparent as possible while also protecting the confidentiality of sensitive information codification and publication laws particularly evaluation criteria used in reviews of investment transactions should be codified and made public prior notification governments should take steps to notify interested parties about plans to change investment policies consultation governments should seek the views of interested parties when they are considering changing investment policies procedural fairness and predictability reviews should have time limits sensitive information should be protected disclosure of investment policy actions governments should disclose investment policy actions as measure of accountability regulatory proportionality restrictions should not be greater than needed to protect national security essential security concerns are selfjudging countries have the right to determine what is necessary to protect their own national security narrow focus investment restrictions s hould be narrowly focused on concerns related to national security appropriate expertise measures related to national security concerns should be designed so that they can benefit from national expertise on national security and that it is possible to weigh the benefits of the investment policies against the impact of the restrictions tailored responses investment measures should be tailored to the specific risks posed by

nations have focused on the concept of critical infrastructure as separate area of concern within the rubric of essential security interests 24 as table 3 indicates national definitions of critical infrastructure differ among countries although most of the countries surveyed by the oecd define critical infrastructure as physical infrastructure that provides essential support for economic and social wellbeing for public safety and for the functioning of key government responsibilities in most cases the national definitions of critical infrastructure are broad statements that provide national governments with wide latitude for deciding which assets or sectors to designate as critical such definitions implicitly acknowledge the importance that the broader economic and security

national treatment instrument retain the option to exclude sectors of their economy on the grounds of essential security interests from the national treatment standard in such cases nations are using discriminatory practices to restrict foreigners from investing in sectors of their economies that are deemed to be important to national security in making such exceptions nations that are parties to the national treatment instrument provide notification to the other members that they are requesting an exemption from the protocol thereby providing method to make the process transparent to all the signatories of the instrument according to recent oecd study countries that are adhering to the oecd national treatment instrument have exempted an extensive array of discriminatory foreign investment policies from the instrument in order to protect critical infras tructure from foreign investment for instance all 39 nations that are party to the instrument re port that they discriminate against foreign investment in one or more critical infrastructure sectors of these sectors transport in the most targeted sector with all 39 countries reported having discriminatory measures 25 such restrictions generally fall within three categories 1 blanket restrictions that cover specific activity 2 sectorspecific restrictions that affect investment in specific sector of the economy and 3 measures that apply to broad range of infrastructure investments and approval procedures that could be used to block infrastructure investments that are deemed to pose threats to essential security interests the oecd also concluded that the national restrictions were notably general in their descriptions in turn the oecd concluded that the generality of the restrictions is due to four issues 1 the nature of the security threats may affect perceived threats and vulnerabilities 2 the assessment of the threats may be affected by the nationality of the foreign investor 3 some perceived threats may be resolved easily through mitigation efforts while others may not and 4 not all countries have the capabilities to conduct indepth evaluations of potential national security threats the oecd also concluded that it is difficult to assess the value such restrictions have in enhancing the essential national security of the members in most cases such policies are measures of last resort when other national laws or measures are determined to be insufficient or they can provide process that assists various agencies within national government with identifying and dealing with security threats that might be posed by international investment 26 25 protection of critical infr astructure and the role of investment policies relating to national security p 6 26 ibid p 8

that direct investment benefits both the home and the host country and that the benefits of such investment outweigh the costs most economists argue that free and unimpeded international flows of capital such as direct investment positively affect both the domestic home and foreign host economies the essence of this argument is that for the home country direct investment abroad benefits individual firms because firms that invest abroad are better able to exploit their existing competitive advantages and are able to acquire additional skills and advantages this tends to further enhance the competitive position of these firms both at home and abroad and shifts the composition and distribution of employment within the economy toward the most productive and efficient firms and away from the less productive firms as host country the united states benefits from inward direct investment because the investment adds permanently to the nations capital stock and skill set direct investment also brings technological advances since firms that invest abroad generally possess advanced technology processes and other economic advant ages such investment also boosts capital

investment contributes to international trade and integration into the global trading community since most firms that invest abroad are established multinational firms27 while us policy toward inward and outward direct investment generally has adhered to the overall objective of treating such investment impartially there are number of notable exceptions these exceptions can be classified as sectoral restrictions that exclude foreign ownership from certain sectors of the economy and approval procedures for mergers acquisitions and takeovers of existing us firms that could be used to block infrastructure investments that are deemed to pose threats to essential national security foreign investors are constrained by us laws that bars foreign ownership in such industrial sectors as maritime aircraft mining energy lands communications banking and government contracting 28 generally these sectors were closed to foreign investors to prevent public services and public interest

discretionary authority to take what action he considers to be appropriate to suspend or prohibit proposed or pending foreign acquisitions mergers or takeovers of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states which threaten to impair the national security the exxonflorio provision does not define national security because congress meant to have the term interpreted broadly nevertheless regulations developed by the treasury department to implement the law direct the members of the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius 31 to focus their reviews of foreign investments exclusively on those transactions that involve products or key technologies essential to the us defense industrial base and not to consider economic concerns more broadly cfius also indicated that in order to as sure an unimpeded inflow of foreign investment it would implement the statute only insofar as necessary to protect the national security and in manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the united states 32 the committee is an interagency organization that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign

arguably the events of september 11 2001 reshaped congressional attitudes toward the exxonflorio provision this change in attitude became apparent in 2006 as result of the public disclosure that dubai ports world 34 was attempting to purchase the britishowned po ports35 with operations in various us ports after the september 11th terrorist attacks congress passed and president bush signed the usa pa triot act of 2001 uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism36 in this act congress provided for special support for critical industries which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters37 this broad definition is enhanced to some degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify sectors of the economy that c ongress considers to be elements in the critical infrastructure of the nation these sectors include telecommunications energy financial services

addition the homeland security act added key resources to the list of critical infrastructure cikr and defined those resources as publicly or privately controlled resources essential to the minimal operations of the economy and government41 through series of directives the department of homeland security identified 17 sectors42 of the economy as falling within the definition of critical

security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altered the way many policymakers view the concept of national security as result many policymakers have concluded that economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security in addition many policymakers apparently perceive greater risks to the economy arising from foreign investments in which the foreign investor is owned or controlled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national security and the operations of cfius for some members of congress cfius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national security because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exxonflorio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security

fundamentally altered the meanin g of national security in the exxonflorio provision by including critical infrastructure and homeland security as areas of concern comparable to national security the law also re quires the director of national intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that may pose threat to the national security the law provides for additional factors the president and cfius are required to use in assessing foreign investments including the implications for the nations critical infrastructure in another change pl 11049 requires cfius to investigate all foreign investment transactions in which the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government regardless of the nature of the business some foreign investors may well regard this approach as change in policy by the united states toward foreign investment prior to this change foreign investment transactions were reviewed in way that presumed that the transactions contributed positively to the economy consequently the burden of proof was on the members of cfius to prove during review that particular transaction threatened to impair national security pl 11049 however shifted the burden onto firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government to prove that they are not threat to national security in any given year the number of investment transactions in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government likely is small compared with the total number of foreign investment transactions the number of such transactions however is growing as some foreign government s experience surge in their foreign exchange reserves and they establish sovereign wealth funds in order to invest part of their reserve funds abroad in an array of activities including in us businesses

the statement reads free and open international investment regime is vital for stable and growing economy both here at home and throughout the world the threat of global terrorism and other national

every necessary step to protect national security my administration recognizes that our prosperity and security are founded on our countrys openness as both the worlds largest investor and the worlds largest recipient of investment the united states has key stake in promoting an open investment regime the united states unequivocally supports international investment in this country and is equally

productivity and fostering competitiveness that allows our companies and their workers to prosper at home and in international markets my administration is committed to ensuring that the united states continues to be the most attractive place in the world to invest i urge other nations to join us in supporting an open investment policy and protecting international investments the cfius process is

board is required to meet at least once every two years to make recommendations regarding materials critical to national security and to report to congress on the results of meetings and on the recommendations of the board in addition the act prohibits the department of defense from buying strategic materials critical to national security unless the metals are reprocessed reused or produced in the united states except under number of conditions including the lack of availability of specialty metals the board is directed in the statute to undertake four activities 1 determine the need to provide long term domestic supply of materials designated as critical to national security to ensure that national defense needs are met 2 analyze the risk associated with each material designated as critical to national security and the effect on national defense that the nonavailability of such material from domestic source would have 3 recommend strategy to the president to ensure the domestic availability of materials designated as critical to national security 4 recommend such other strategies to the president as the board considers appropriate to strengthen the industrial base with

policies is raising questions about how policymakers can evaluate the economic costs and benefits of such measures when the measures are designed to restrict mergers acquisitions and takeovers of domestic firms by foreign investors for national security reasons indeed such measures can sometimes focus more on achieving noneconomic objectives than on achieving economic efficiency or on supporting marketbased allocation of resources in addition such policies often expose differing political and philosophical differences between policymakers within countries and among countries within the united states for instance such differences exist among members of congress and between congress and the administration over the role foreign investment should play in the economy this analysis becomes especially complicated because each nation has the authority to define its essential security concerns on its own terms and to adjust its foreign investment policy to meet that definition as result such policies defy straightforward costbenefit analysis and can mask economic protectionism this section discusses one possible framework for assessing the economic impact of more restrictive investment policies part of the difficulty involved in assessing the economic impact is that at present there is working set of parameters that establishes functional definition of the national security implications of such economic activities as mergers acquisitions or takeovers of existing us firms by foreign investors this process of evaluation is even more difficult in peace time when there is immediate national security threat posed by foreign investment that dictates the course of national security policies in most cases government actions to stop or curtail foreign direct investment in the form of merger an acquisition or takeover of an existing us firm are mainly precautionary measures aimed at addressing potential future actions that foreign investor may take 47 this process of identification is also complicated on multilateral basis because 47 international investment perspectives p 5463 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151

definition of national security and its own approach to formulating policies regarding the role of economic activity within the national security rubric whether intended or not intervention in the economy on national security grounds creates mix of industrial activities that most likely would not be achieved through traditional economic market forces such intervention often is associated with three types of economic activity first the intervention may involve efforts to prevent foreign firms from acquiring certain us firms as result of the type of economic activity that characterizes the us firm or is related to the nature of the output produced by the us firm second opposition on national security grounds may arise as result of concerns over the country of origin of the foreign acquirer this type of concern has grown over the recent past because of the growing role of sovereign wealth funds controlled by foreign governments third national policies may provide special consideration for certain economic activities in the form of economic incentives for us firms or barriers against foreign acquisition due to belief that the targeted economic activities are important to national security in some cases intervention in the foreign investment process may be justified on combination of economic and non economic arguments in these cases the economic costs and benefits that accrue to the economy as result of the policy actions may be tied directly to an assessment of the particular set of circumstances within which the costbenefit analysis is conducted in the standard textbook presentation economic production arises from combination of the four main types of resources or factors of production namely land labor capital and entrepreneurial ability of these four factors labor and capital are generally singled out due to their overwhelming importance in the production process growth within an economy then is generally believed to arise from growth in the two main factors of production capital and labor which are considered to be fixed at any particular point in time over time however the rate of growth in the labor force combined with the rate of growth in capital accumulation or in the way in which capital is used generally referred to as the rate of growth in productivity set limits on the rate at which the economy can grow in dynamic economy such as that of the united states some sectors are expanding or growing at rate that is faster than the economy as whole while other sectors are either declining or are growing at rate that is slower than the ec onomy as whole since the growth rate in the economy is governed by the rate of growth in the labor force and in productivity any sector of the economy that grows faster than the average rate for the economy as whole can only do so by absorbing capital and labor from other sectors of the economy that then must be declining or growing at rate that is less than the averag for the economy as whole assuming that the economy is growing at close to full employment over time the growing sectors of the economy necessarily take away capital and labor from the declining sectors of the economy in the short run this transformative process may be uneven and may well lead to mismatch in skills between sectors which likely would result in some unused or underutilized resources within the economy economic theory maintains that demand and supply forces determine the market prices for labor and for capital as the various sectors compete for these scarce resources these market prices then work to allocate resources within the economy among the vast array of economic activities into those activities that use the resources in the most efficient manner interference in this process regardless of the reason can cause misallocation of resources in the economy and loss of efficiency which imposes cost on the economy as whole in the case of government incentives or subsidies for favored industry the cost to the economy arises from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151

the direct cost involved in shifting resources into the protected sectors of the economy that are at variance with the way in which market forces would allocate those resources the second cost is the

market forces or the opportunity cost to the economy that arises from misallocation of resources while mergers acquisitions or takeovers of existing us firms by foreign investors imply at least change in ownership foreign investors may well possess additional technology or other advantages that have made them successful international competitors that would be lost if such an investment were prevented for national security reasons economists argue that both direct and indirect costs arise when national policies are used to intervene in the foreign investment process becau such intervention generally is contrary to market forces which act to maximize production efficiencies government policies that attempt to enhance national security by restricting acquisitions mergers and takeover of existing us firms by foreign investors may also alter the allocation of capital within the economy and thereby incur shortterm and longterm costs to the economy for purposes of analysis economists often divide production and other economic activities into two time periods the short run and the long run the distinction between the short run and the long run is not absolute but is based on the ability of the economy to shift resources among sectors based on market forces generally labor is thought to be the most mobile factor of production that can be shifted relatively quickly among sectors within the economy and at lower shortrun cost than capital on the other hand capital is generally thought of as comparatively more difficult to shift among economic sectors over the shortrun for instance workers can shift into and out of jobs in response to market demand while it is difficult to shift production facilities or buildings from one locale to another as result in the short run labor is thought of as the variable factor of production while capital is thoug ht of as fixed factor of production in the longrun however all factors are viewed as variable since all of the factors can be reallocated to other sectors of the economy in response to shifts in longterm market forces this division between the short run and the long run simply means that under normal market conditions the costs of reallocating resources within the economy through public policy measures or preventing the allocation of capital into certain sectors through foreign investment that are not in tandem with market forces would accrue high shortrun economic costs that would need an equally high combination of shortrun and longrun benefits in order to justify the costs to the economy the distinction between the shortrun and the longrun can change depending on conditions within the economy that may require shift in capital and labor among sectors of the economy for instance after the united states entered world war ii the us economy shifted from peacetime consumeroriented economy to wartime armsproducing economy within relatively short period of time because the external threats to the country were so great that dramatic shift in the industrial mix of the economy was considered to be necessary shortrun cost that justified overriding market forces in order to produce quickly the material necessary to defend the nation in this case the benefits to the economy in terms of added security principally the ability to defend the country from invasion or destruction outweighed the shortrun and long run costs to the economy in terms of shifting resources into sectors of the economy that would not have been given priority under peacetime conditions in peacetime without an imminent external threat it is difficult to determine the economic parameters that define the terms critical infrastructure homeland security and key

is difficult to define clearly what role foreign investment should play as separately definable component of national security this is particularly true in the case of an individual economic transaction such as the acquisition of us firm by foreign firm in these cases the threats to the country often are not well defined or understood and it often is not an easy proposition to evaluate the costs and benefits to the economy as whole of protecting or promoting certain economic activities similarly it is often difficult to determine the national security elements of allowing or barring investors who are of certain foreign nationalities from acquiring us firms this problem is compounded under the current war on terrorism in which potential threats to the united states may be decentralized and originate in subnational organizations when policymakers decide to promote certain types of economic activities or to protect us firms or economic activities from foreign investment on the grounds of national security those officials are in effect weighing the costs and benefits to the nation or more specifically the marginal costs and marginal benefits of intervening to alter the mix of industrial activity in the economy the costs in this case would include the direct shortrun and longrun marginal costs associated with blocking foreign capital from being invested in certain favored sectors of the economy in contravention of market forces and in the case of incentives for favored industries the indirect costs involved in reducing the available capital and labor that could be used in the economy for more productive activities or the opportunity cost of the labor and capital the marginal benefits that accrue to the nation from such policy activities arise from combination of number of factors the nation may well benefit from the perceived gain in national security and the economy may gain through the capital inflow that is represented by the foreign investment in the form of merger acquisition or takeover of an existing us firm foreign investors may also benefit the economy by bringing technological or other production advantages to the united states foreign invest ment may also benefit the economy by sustaining jobs and by producing actual goods and services these benefits may also include what may be termed the national security component of production or that part of production that satisfies national security concerns presumably the economic benefits would need to be at least as great as the noneconomic benefits in order for national policymakers to justify the economic costs if noneconomic benefits comprise the largest share of the expected benefits that arise from the policy action such policy course might be economic protectionism in the guise of national security and policymakers may realize greater benefits for the nation by pursuing different policy course that accrues fewer economic costs in addition the economic and noneconomic benefits that are associated with particular policy may accrue to large contingent within the economy as would be the case in national emergency or they may accrue to few as is often the case with economic protectionism while this distinction between the dispersion of beneficiaries and the allocation of the benefits within the economy is not an absolute way of evaluating national investment policies it does provide one measure for assessing the distinction between measures that accrue high economic costs relative to few economic benefits within the economy as whole and may argue in favor of pursuing different policy course in some cases the citizens of nation may be willing to absorb high shortrun and longrun costs in order to achieve some noneconomic national security goal that benefits small contingent within the economy in such case however it may be possible to achieve such national security goal thr ough means other than through foreign investment policies that entail lower costs for the economy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151

component of production may also be equated with noneconomic good that satisfies national or social objective related to some public assessment of national security the basis for such noneconomic national security benefits can be thought of as spectrum of benefits that are associated with similar spectrum of national security threats these threats can then be thought of as running from threats of i mminent destruction that would affect the economy as whole to concerns about potential activities that are at best tangentially associated with national security and that affect narrow set of workers and limited amount of capital as result of this spectrum of potential versus real threats and the dangers the threats pose to the economy the benefits associated with policies that are advanced on the grounds of national security will be stronger or weaker depending on the context within which the argument is made regardless of the nature of the national security threat the direct and indirect costs to the economy that arise from intervention in the investment process may be the same and pose costs to the economy since the costs to the economy that arise from intervention likely are the same the key to public policy choices is the perceived benefits that are associated with satisfying or addressing such national security concerns in this way the marginal costs associated with intervention are equivalent to the marginal benefits that are derived from the policy actions and may be thought of as the cost of satisfying such national security concerns in the time of full scale war the costs to the country of intervening in the economy to redirect resources to produce defense and war material are justified on the basis of the obvious benefits that arise from national survival in less dire circumstances however such costbenefit comparisons are great deal more difficult to make g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 policymakers in the united states and abroad have increased their scrutiny of foreign investment in their economies as component of national security there is precise way however to estimate the exact dollar amount for the economic costs and benefits of national policies that attempt to direct or restrict foreign direct investment for national security concerns also it can be difficult to determine if foreign investment policies ultimately result in enhanced national security or are form of economic protectionism in concept the economic costs and benefits associated with restrictive foreign investment policies can be evaluated to determine the overall impact of such policies on the long run economic performance of country evaluating and assessing the national security importance of such policies is complicated however because any such assessment naturally occurs within the context with which the assessment takes place nation facing an imminent threat of destruction or annihilation is willing to accept extraordinarily high economic costs in order to address such danger within the united states the proposed acquisition of po ports by dubai ports world in 2006 and the growing presence of investors that are owned or controlled by foreign governments has sparked debate between members of congress and the administration over the role of foreign investment in the economy part of this debate is focused on determining working set of parameters that establish functional definition of the national security implications of foreign direct investment in part this issue reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the economy and differing political and philosophical views among members of congress and between the congress and the administration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151

states has participated in discussions spearheaded by the oecd to develop set of best practices to serve as guidelines for national policies that restrict foreign investment for national security objectives presently the participants have agreed that each nation is its own best judge of its national security interests at the same time they have agreed that national policies that restrict foreign investment for national security reasons should be transparent predictable and nondiscriminatory the final oecd report is scheduled for release in may 2009 and likely will contain set of best practices that members of congress may opt to review as guide concerning us laws and regulations that govern the us treatment of foreign investment relative to us national security objectives there are number of factors that complicate efforts to assess the impact of policies that restrict foreign investment for national security concerns some of those factors include the difficulties that are involved in attaching precise dollar amount to the economic costs and benefits that are associated with such foreign investment poli cies one possible framework for assessing such policies is based on the concept of marginal costs and benefits to the nation that accrue from policies that restrict foreign investment in this case the benefits are some combination of the economic and noneconomic benefits that might be expected to arise from the restrictions while the costs include set of real costs that the economy would be expected to incur as result of the policies measures that restrict foreign direct investment that are based on expectations of achieving large noneconomic benefits relative to economic benefits and to large economic costs may not be an effective tool instead there may be other policy tools that could utilized to achieve the same goal but with lower costs to the economy while not determinative another way of assessing such restrictions is by examining the dispersion of the benefits throughout the economy at times nation may well be willing to absorb the high costs that could be involved in protecting some economic activities by restricting or controlling foreign investment generally though it seems reasonable to assume that policy that is implemented in order to restrict foreign investment that offers benefits to small group of individuals within the economy and that entails high economic costs relative to benefits especially where noneconomic benefits are large share of the expected benefits could be replaced by other measures that accrue lower costs to the economy g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance
