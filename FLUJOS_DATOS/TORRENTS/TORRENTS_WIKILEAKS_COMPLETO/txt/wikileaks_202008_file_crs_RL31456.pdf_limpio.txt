funding the two largest programs focus on cleaning up past contamination and on complying w ith environmental laws and regulations that apply to ongoing operations three ot her programs have smaller budgets they focus on pollution prevention environm ental technology and conservation for fy2003 congress appropriated tota l of 420 billion for all five of dods environmental programs about 90 million m ore than the adminis trations request of 411 billion and about 45 million more tha n the fy2002 funding level of nearly 416 billion refer to page 17 for discussion of authorizing legislation and appropriations for fy2003 background information on each program and an analysis of major implementation issues are discussed below environmental cleanup in 1975 dod established an installation restoration program to investigate and clean up sites on military lands where past waste management practices had led to environmental contamination few years l ater the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liab ility act of 1980 cercla created the superfund program to clean up hazardous wa ste sites that pose the greatest risk to public health and the environment in the united states and it created the national priorities list npl to track them2the law also established formal framework for the identification investigation and c leanup of hazardous s ubstances initially the extent to which dod had to comply with these requirements was unclear however the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 sara specified that dod and all other federal agencies are subject to cerclas requirements for identifying evaluatin g and cleaning up npl sites under their jurisdiction3the resource conservation and recovery act rcra also requires dod and all other federal agencies to perform corrective actions to clean up contamination at sites with active hazardous waste management or solid waste disposal facilities operating with permits issued under rcra4 in addition to specifying the applicability of cercla sara expanded the installation restoration program and renamed it the defense environmental restoration program to centralize dod s efforts in cleaning up hazardous waste sites at domestic military installations where past actions led to contamination5as complement to this program dod established military munitions response program to fulfill requirements under sec tions 311 and 312 of the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 to identify investigate and clean uphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs4 6department of

united states this program is in its initial stage and only portion of contaminated sites have been identified thus far as dod continues to identify additional sites and investigate the extent of contamination more information will be available on the actions and costs that w ill be necessary to address the safety and environmental hazards presented by uxo the following sections explain the role of epa and the states in conducting oversig ht of dods cleanup activities indicate cleanup status and costs explain appr opriations account structure and discuss cleanup efforts at overseas military installations oversight of cleanup activities while dod is responsible for funding and conducting cleanup actions at its sites epa and the states conduct oversight of these actions to determine whether dod complies with the law generally epa takes the lead in performing oversight of dod sites being cleaned up under cercla and epa delegates federal author ity to the states for conducting oversight of corrective actions taken under rcra however cleanup requirements under cercla and rcra apply only within the united states the cleanup of contamination at overseas military installations is subject to requirements specified within the status of forces agreement with each host nation these requirements are generally not as strict as cercla and rcra and their stringency varies widely from country to country unlike domestic cleanup actions epa does not have the authority to c onduct oversight at military installations abroad rather overseeing dods actions to ensure that the requireme nts of status of forces agreement are met is the responsibility of each host nation cleanup status and costs until fy1994 dod primarilyconcentrated its cleanup efforts on identifying and investigating contaminated sites to determine the level of remediation that would be nece ssary to protect human health and the environment as the majority of sites were i dentified and subse quent investigations were completed dod began to focus the bulk of its efforts on actual cleanup in fy1996 dod also developed specific cleanup goals to prioritize its sites based on threats of exposure as indicated in figure 2 dod had identified total of 29696 contaminated sites as of the end of fy20026as of that time dod had completed cleanup at 20491 of those sites 69 of total sites at cost of 202 billion and reported that almost 302 billion would be necessary to finish cleanup at the remaining 9205 sites 31 of total s ites from fy2003 to site completion even though less than 13 of contaminated sites are still in need of cleanup the above estimates of future cleanup costs are substantially higher than has already been spent due to the severity of contamination at these remaining sites and the resources that likely will be necessary to address uxo contamination dod expects that estimates of funding needs will likely incr ease in future years as additional sites with uxo contamination are identified and the extent of such contamination is determined funding needs for cleanup also may rise in future years as additional military bases are selected for closure the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 authorized new round of military base closings in 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs5 7congress first appropriated funding to the defense environmental restoration account in fy1984 subsequently the national defense authorization act for fy1997 pl 104201 divided the account into four sub accounts army navy air force and defensewide since then congress also has specified the amount of funding reserved for cleaning up fuds sites and the national defense authorization act for fy2001 pl 106 398 established fuds subaccount to conform with this budgetary practicetotal number of sites 29696 prepared by the congressional research service using data from the department of defense fy2002 defense environmental restoration program annual

states as of september 30 2002the amount of funding that would be n ecessary to accelerate cleanup at new base closure sites and transfer them to other uses would depend on the type and extent of contamination present at such installations costs to accelerate cleanup could be high if the bases selected for closure contain some of the more severely contaminated sites that are on the npl and are subject to cleanup under cercla appropriations account structure cleanup costs at domestic military sites are funded byseveral centralized account s structured by category of installation funding for cleanup at current and former military installations is authorized under five defense environmental restoration ccounts in the annual authorization bill for national defense and is ppropriated to these accounts i n the annual appropriations bill for the department of defense thre of these accounts reserve funding for the army navy and air force one devotes funding to more general category of defensewide sites and another is dedicated to cleaning up formerly used defense sites fuds7typically fuds are sites on prope rties that dod owned or leasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs6 8department of defense defense environmental quality program annual report to congress for fy2001 september 2002 p 29in the past and are now devoted to civilian uses many of the fuds sites were used during the world war ii era and prior years the department of defense appropr iations act for fy2003 pl 107248 provided total of 131 billion for all fiv defense environmental restoration accounts about 30 million more than the ad ministrations request of 128 billion and nearly 40 million more the fy2002 funding level of 127 billion the increase in funding was reserved for improving th pace of cleanup at fuds sites which has been criticized for proceeding more slowly than cleanup at currently active installations refer to page 22 f or further discussion of pl 107248 cleanup at base closure sites is aut horized separately under the base realignment and closure brac acc ount in the annual authorization bill for national defense appropriations for bas closure activities are provided under the brac account in the annual appropriations b ill for military construction congress authorized four rounds of base cl osures in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 and established separate brac account for each round these sites are separate from former military properties known as fuds which are discussed above the military construction appropriations ac t for fy2003 pl 107249 provided 561 million for the brac account from which dod allocated 540 million for cleanup activities at base closure sites this amount is about 69 million less than the fy2002 cleanup allocation of 609 million ref er to page 23 for further discussion of pl 107249 overseas military installations as discussed above there are several centralized accounts to fund cleanup activ ities at domestic military installations however there are lineitem acc ounts in the presid ents annua l budget submission or in annual defense authoriz ation legislation or appropriations to conduct cleanup actions at overseas military inst allations rather these projects are funded on an installationby installation basis out of the general operational budget for each foreign base and dod does not have the authority to transfer funding from the cleanup accounts for domestic installa tions to address contamination abroad further dod is not required to report to c ongress on the status of cleanup actions at overseas military installations as the agency is required to do for domestic facilities in its annual repor t on the defense environmental restoration program the only type of information that dod is re quired to submit to congress regarding overseas cleanup is statement of the am ounts expended and anticipated to be expended as part of its annual report to c ongress on the defense environmental quality program the most recent version of this report indicated that dod spent total of 196 million in fy2001 on overseas nvironmental cleanup the report also indicated that 131 million was available from appropriations in fy2002 and that in fy2003 182 million would be required for overseas cleanup obligations8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs7 942 usc 6961environmental compliance dod and all other federal agencies are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations to the same extent as any other entity typically environmental compliance projects at military installations include routine operations such as storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste upgrading and monitoring waste water treatment plants and testing and replacing underground storage tanks the following sections provide information on nvironmental complia nce requirements under federal law examine funding trends for military compliance activities and indicate the amount of fines and pena lties assessed against and paid by dod for environmental violations compliance requirements under federal law the federal environmental statutes that most commonlyapplyto the militarys routine operations include the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act rcra and safe drinking water act the federal facility compliance act of 1992 amended rcra to clarify in detail that dod and all other federal facilities are subject to penalties fines permit fees reviews of plans or studies and inspection and monitoring of facilities in connection with fe deral state interstate or local solid or hazardous waste regulatory programs9the act also authorized and directed epa to take enforcement actions under rcra against any federal agency to the same extent that it would against any other entity although the safe drinking water act includes similar language other federal environmental laws do not include the same clarification of compliance requirements funding trends dod did not begin to comprehensively track the amount of funding spent on environmental comp liance activities til fy1990 however there are centralized accounts for these activities in annual defense authorization legislation or appropriations bills as there are for environmental cleanup activities instead funding for compliance primarily comes from the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction and procurement dods budget for environmental compliance has ranged from 790 million in fy1990 to high of 223 billion in fy1996 for fy2003 dod allocated 175 billion for compliance activities from the available accounts i dentified above about 80 million more than the fy2002 funding level of 167 billion in the fy2003 budget request dod had indicated that an increase in funding for c ompliance would be allocated primarily to meet environmental requirements for certain air force activities and to implement waste water and drinking water treatment projects at the massachusetts military reservation in falmouth ma ssachusetts the safety of drinking water has been an ongoing concern among communities surr ounding the reservation since groundwater contamination was discovered in priva and municipal drinking water wells fines for violations of envi ronmental requirements although dod is required to comply with environmental l aws and regulations and has dedicated budget for such activities the extent to which dod fulfills these responsibilities has been longstanding issue as explained bove federal environmental laws require federal facilities to

congress for fy2001 september 2002 appendix j p 19 12ibid appendix j p 23requirements and such laws authorize epa the states and local governments to assess fines against dod for violations however fine is not always paid in the same year that it is assessed and in some cases dod does not make cash payment to satisfy fine instead dod may agree to perform supplemental environmental project sep in lieu of cash payment under such an agreement dod not only corrects its actions to comply with the envi ronmental requirement at hand but also performs an additional project that enhances environmental quality regulatory agencies frequently prefer the performance of seps to cash payments due to the environmental benefits reaped from such projects the national defense authorizatio n act for fy2000 required dod to include information on environmental fines in its annual report to congress on the defense environmental quality program10this information must include the amount of fines assessed and paid during the fiscal year for which the report is submitted as well as the past four fiscal years as indicated in table 1 epa the states and local governments assessed 118 million in fines against dod for environmental violations from fy1997 to fy200111during this same period dod paid 116 million in cash payments and seps as compensation for its violations12 table 1 fines and penalties assessed

to congress for fy2001 september 2002 appendix j p 19 and p 23 however the total amount indicated bove for assessed fines does not include penalty of 16 million that epa raised against the us army in fy2000 for violations of the clean air act at fort wa inwright in alaska t he appropriateness of the amount of the fine is currently in dispute and it is the single largest penalty that epa has ever assessed against dod for an environmental violation epa used the criteria of economic benefit of nonc ompliance and sizeofbusiness to determine the amount of the fine which are or dinarily applied to p rivate businesses the army argued that because federal facilities receive their funds fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs9 13ibid appendix k p 10appropriations and must spend the money for the purpose for which it was appropriated federal facility cannot realize an economic benefit from non compliance13the army also argued that the sizeofbusiness criteria should not be applied since military facilities are not net assets in the traditional sense and could not be used as financial resource to pay fine on april 30 2002 the presiding epa administrative law judge rejected the armys arguments and ruled that epa could apply the criteria of economic benefi t of noncompliance and sizeofbusiness to the army the army requested that the nvironmental appeals board review this decision other environmental programs in addition to environmental cleanup and compliance dod administers three other programs that focus on pollution pr evention environmental technology and conservation the purpose of the pollutio n prevention program is to reduce or eliminate solid or hazardous waste from bei ng generated and prevent environmental problems before they occur the environmental technology program supports research development testing and demons tration of more efficient and less costly methods to clean up and manage solid and hazardous waste the conservation program aims to protect the natural his torical and cultural resources of the 25 million acres of public land that dod administers including the protection of endangered species dod began tracking the budget for these programs in fy1993 although these programs are an integral part of dods environmental strategy their funding is significantly smaller than the programs fo r environmental cleanup and compliance like compliance there are centra lized accounts for pollution prevention environmental technology or conservation i n annual defense author ization legislation or appropriations bills instead dod allo cates funding for these activities primarily from the accounts for operation and mainte nance procurement and research and development from fy2003 appropriations for the above accounts dod allocated relatively small increase in funding for conservation but slightly decreased its budget for pollution prevention and environmen tal technology for conservation dod budgeted 1603 million for fy2003 38 million i ncrease above the fy2002 funding level of 1565 million the budget for pollution prevention declined by 63 million from 2261 million in fy2002 to 2198 million in fy2003 for environmental technology projects dod allocated 2265 million for fy2003 16 million decrease from the fy2002 budget of 2281 million while the overall fy2003 budget for environmental technology declined slightly dod had indicated in its fy2003 budget request that funding within the technology program would be increased for developing new ways to detect and clean up uxo and other munitions the development of such technologies will lik ely be crucial in efforts to accurately identify and assess contaminated site s under the new military munitions response program discussed

office military training dod needs comprehensive plan to manage encroachment on training ranges gao02727t may 2002 p 2military readiness issues major issue associated with the implementation of dods environmental programs is the extent to which environmental requirements restrict military readiness capabilities while most federal environmental laws specify their applicability to federal facilities congress included exemptions in several statutes to ensure that military training needs would not be restricted to the extent that national security would be compromised14these exemptions provide the president with the authorityto suspend compliance requirements for actions at federal facilities on casebycase basis such exemptions may be granted if doing so would be either in the paramount interest of the united s tates or in the in terest of national security most of these exemptions are limited to one year but can be renewed the safe drinking water act does not impose time limit on exemptions from compliance under the endangered species act special committee shall grant an exemption if the secretary of defense finds it necessary for national security this committee may place time limit on an exemption but it is not required to do so under the law the adequacy of existing exemptions to meet national security needs has become controversial issue dod argues that existing exemptions are too onerous and timeconsuming to obtain on casebycase basis due to the vast number of training exercises that it conducts on hundreds of military installations across the country dod also argues that the time limitations placed upon most exemptions are not compatible with manytraining activities due to their ongoing or recurring nature instead dod favors modifications to numer ous environmental statutes that would provide greater flexibility for conducting combat training and other readiness activities without restriction or delay how ever some states and environmental organizations have opposed such modifica tions and argue that existing exemptions are sufficient to accommodate combat training needs the cumulative effect of environmental requirements on military readiness capabilities is difficult to determine due to the lack of system to comprehensively track individual cases in which training has been restricted or compromised the general accounting office gao has found that dods readiness reports do not indicate the extent to which environmental r equirements restric t combat training activities and that such reports indicate high level of readiness overall15however gao noted individual instances of envi ronmental encroachment at numerous military installations and in light of this fact recommended that dods

requirements oversight hearings were held during the 107thcongress to examine the impact of environmental requirements on military readiness and this issue was debated in legislation as well the national defen authorization act for fy2003 pl 107 314 included an interim exemption for military readiness activities from the migratory bird treaty act in addition to this exemption the house had proposed modifications to the endangered species act and targeted exemption from the wilderness act which wer not adopted in conference dod had requested an exemption from the migratory bird treaty act as part of readiness and range preservation initiative rrpi submitted to congress in april 2002 dod submitted its rrpi to congress in response to concerns over the perceived increase in training restricti ons imposed by environmental requirements the initiative proposed targeted exemptions for military readiness activities from certain requirements under five other stat utes as well including the clean air act comprehensive environmental respons compensation and liability act endangered species act marine mammal protection act and solid waste disposal act dods request for targeted exempti ons from these five laws were not included in the final fy2003 defense authorization bill refer to page 17 for further discussion of pl 107314 dod submitted its rrpi to congress again in the spring of 2003 and it has been subject to debate in fy2004 defe nse authorization legislation16oversight of the issue of environmental encroachment will likely continue in the future as dod continues to balance military readiness needs with requirements to comply with environmental laws department of energy in the late 1980s the united states ceased its production of radioactive materials used in the construction of nuc lear weapons due to military projections that the nuclear weapons stockpile was suffici ent to protect national security and respond to future threats however environmen tal

nuclear waste the law requires doe to safely store process transport and dispose of radio active and other hazardous waste resulting from the production of defense nuclear materials18waste disposal typicallyinvolves cleanup actions such as the decontamina tion of buildings and structures and the removal of contaminated soil doe is also subject to requirements under various federal environmental laws in carryin g out its responsibilities under the atomic energy act cercla and rcra are the two main federal environmental statutes that apply to cleanup activities at defense nuclear waste sites cercla primarily applies to cleanup actions at inactive waste sites which present the highest risk of exposure and are listed on the npl rcra requires doe to clean up contamination at sites with active solid and hazardous waste disposal facilities for which an operating permit has been issued under rcra epa and the states are responsible for conducting oversight of does actions in order to determine compliance with environmental laws and assess fines and penalties if violations occur generally epa takes the lead in performing oversight of cleanup actions at doe sites required under cercla and epa delegates federal authority to the states for conducting oversight of actions required under rcra doe has completed compliance agreements with epa and the states for each of its cleanup

of contract differs from the traditional approach of paying contractor f ixed amount upfront and offering additional cash incentives to encourage the completion of project within certain time frame

cleanup some members expressed concern about how the funding for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs15 proposed reform account would have been allo cated among various sites there also were concerns regarding how the goals of accelerated cleanup and reduced costs would be accomplished without compromising environmental protection in response to these concerns congress instead increased the

environmental management program is the perceived need for longterm centralized repository for highlevel defense nuclear waste while the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico serves as centralized repository for lowlevel and transuranic p lutoniumcontaminated defense nuclear waste highlevel waste is currently stor ed at individual sites many interests have argued that centrally storing highlevel waste in location that lacks potential pathway for immediate exposure would be safer and more secure from potential terrorist threats in response to such cerns the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 as amended in 1987 required doe to study the suitability of yucca mountain in nevada for constructing an underground geol ogical repository for highlevel defense nuclear waste as well as civilian radioactive waste generated by nuclear power plants the federal government and the nuclear power industry contribute funding to support the study and development of such repository the state of nevada has strongly opposed the selection of yucca mountain for an underground repository due to numerous sa fety concerns such as the possibility of seismological disturbances and underground flooding and the potential for groundwater contamination over time doe contends that scientific evidence indicates that the conditions at yucca mountain would likely be suitable for long term underground waste storage and that effo rts to study the site should continue environmental organizations have opposed the development of centralized repositorydue to concerns over the safetyof tr ansporting highlevel radioactive waste across many states to one location and the potential for terrorist threats along with environmental concerns about the site that are similar to those of the state of nevada taking these concerns into considera tion president bush recommended yucca mountain for site selection on februar 8 2002 however nevada governor kenny guinn submitted notice of

128 billion and is about 50 millio n more than the fy2002 funding level of 127 billion the increase in authorization was devoted to the cleanup of fuds sites the pace of cleanup at these sites has been an ongoing concern since cleanup activities have historically proceeded more slowly than at currently active installations regarding the use of defe nse funds for cleanup section 313 requires the secretary of defense to fund envi ronmental cleanup projects only with environmental restoration funds and not as military construction projects section 2404 authorized 565 million for base closure activities which includes the cleanup of environmental conta mination at such sites this amount is 20 million more than the administration s fy2003 request of 545 million and is 68 million less than the enacted fy2002 appropriation of 633 million the conference report indicated that the increase in author ization above the request is only to be used for environmental cleanup rather than gene ral activities related to closure for the sake of clarity there also appears to be conflicting language in the conference report regarding the amount author ized for base closure activities although report language indicates an amount of 561 milli on the law specified 565 million which would be the actual authorization since it is stipulated in statutory language in addition to comprehensive funding fo r cleanup at military facilities section 301 authorized the requested amount of 25 million for the kahoolawe island conveyance remediation and environm ental restoration trust fund dod

earlier dod requested exemptions from or modifications to several environmenta l statutes as part of readiness and range preservation initiative submitted to congre ss in april 2002 dod argued that certain exemptions and modifications are needed to provide greater compliance flexibility in order to prevent environmental requi rements from imposing restrictions on military readiness cap abilities some members of c ongress certain states and numerous environmental organizations opposed the initiative and argued that existing exemption authorities are adequate to protect training needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs19 27for legal analysis refer to crs report rl31415 the endangered species act migratory bird treaty act and department of defense readiness activities current law and legislative proposals by pamela baldwin 2816 usc 703 et seqin passing hr 4546 the house approved an exemption from the migratory bird treaty act and modifications to the endangered species act which were requested as part of dods proposed initia tive the house also approved targeted exemption from the wilderness act for military overflights on the utah test and training range the senate did not pr opose any environmental exemptions in passing its version of the bill the conf erence committee on hr 4546 did not adopt the provisions regarding the endangered species act or the wilderness act but did approve modified version of the exemptio n from the migratory bird treaty act which is contained in section 315 of pl 10731427 conflicts between military training needs and the protection of migratory birds arose as result of federal court ruling which indicated that the navy had violated the migratorybird treaty act by incident allytaking migratorybirds without permit during training exercises in guam the migratory bird treaty act was established to control the mass slaughter of migratory birds for commercial purposes and to promote the sustainable management of such birds28the law authorizes the secretary of the interior to regulate the taking of migratory birds but current regulations may only authorize permits for intentional takings for specific purposes such as hunting within designated seasons as well as numerous other activities to address the lack of permit authority for incidental takings and prevent possible restrictions on training in the f uture section 315 of pl 107314 requires the secretary of the interior to prescribe regulations within one year of enactment that would exempt military readiness activities from the protections under the migratory bird treaty act the conference report did not explain whether prescribe means propose or finalize how ever it appears that prescribe means final promulgation of the regulations when the section is read as whole the law defines readiness activities as all training and operations of the armed forces that are related to combat as well as the adequate and realistic testing of military equipment vehicles weapons and sensors for proper operation and suitability for combat use while the new regulations are being developed the law grants an interim exemption from the migratory bird treaty act in order to allow any potentially affected training operations to proceed during the interim period the secretary of defense is required to consult with the secretary of the interior to monitor minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts on migratory birds whenever practicable interim exemption authority will expire when the new regulations become effective and all litigation challenging them has been reso lved to restrict the amount of time during which legal challenges could be raised the law limits judicial review by federal court to 120 days from the date that the regulations are published although pl 107314 does not include modifications to the endangered species act the conference report on hr 4546 expressed concern that designating additional critical habitat areas on training ranges could adversely affect militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs20 29as amended in 1997 the sikes act 16 usc 670a requires dod to develop an inrmp for each military installation in the united states unless

with the us fish and wildlife service and state fish and wildlife agencies in the preparation of these plans to reach mutual agr eement on the conservation protection and management of fish and wildlife resourcesreadiness capabilities the house originally would have amended the endangered species act to prohibit the designation of new critical habitat areas on military installations for which an integrated natural resource management plan inrmp has been approved under the sikes act if t he plan addresses special management considerations or protection29the conferees expressed their support for the level of cooperation between dod and the departme nt of the interior to prepare effective inrmps to protect threatened and endangered species and indicated their concerns about questions as to whether inrmps provi sufficient protection to eliminate the need for further critical habitat designations the conferees encouraged the department of the interior and dod to coope rate in the management of natural and cultural resources on military lands and directed the secretary of defense to recommend legislative proposals to accomplish these goals procurement practices various laws regulations and executive orders require federal agencies to procure recycled or environmentally preferable items whenever it is practical to do so section 314 requires the secretary of defense to establish tracking system to identify the extent to which the defense logistics agency procures items that are environmentally preferable or are made with recovered materials this provision also requires the secretary of defense to assess the need for training and educating military personnel to ensure that they are aware of any requirements preferences or goa ls for the procurement of environmentally preferable items or those made with recovered materials related to procurement section 827 authorizes multiyear authority for procuring services related to the cleanup of environmental contamination on military installations since many types of cleanup remedies are longterm actions multiyear authority is often more practical than annual authorizations natural resource conservation pl 107314 includes two natural resource conservation provisions that ddress the impacts of land development on military installations in many areas wild life populations have increased on military lands as surrounding open spaces and hab itat have diminished due to property development dod argues that environmen tal requirements to protect endangered and threatened species have risen as consequence and that such requirements have placed limitations on the use of certain lands t prevent further land development and help ease the burden of habitat pre servation on military lands section 2811 authorizes the secretary of defense to ter cooperative agreements with states and private entities to acquire or obtain interest in nearby properties to preserve open space and protect critical habitat such properties would serve as buffer to help eliminate or relieve restrictions on training testing or other operations that might otherwise be imposed if the availability of open space and wildlife habitat were limited to military lands due to surrounding property development to meet this same objective section 2812 authorizes th secretary of defense to convey surplushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs21 property to state or local governments or non profit conservation organizations to preserve open space or natural resources in perpetuity use and disposal of obsolete naval vessels section 3504 authorizes financial assistance to states for prepari ng obsolete vessels from the national defense reserve fleet for use as artificial reef s the law does not specify how much funding is authorized and the amount of assistance would depend on the availability of appropriations eligible activities include removing hazardous materials from vessel towing it to the target location and sinking it the amount of assistance awarded to state would depend on numerous factors such as the costeffectiveness of reefing vessel compared to other di sposal options later than september 30 2003 the maritime administration and ep are required to jointly develop environmental best management practices to serve as national guideline for preparing vessels as artificial reefs in addition to the use of artificial reefs as disposal option section 3504 directs the maritime administration to carry out pilot program to explore alternatives for exporting obsolete naval vessels abroad to be dismantled and recycled the maritime ad ministration already has the authority to export vessels for these purposes and the p ilot program is intended to identify more effective and safer practices for disposal abroad department of energy section 3101 authorized total of 676 billion for does management of defense nuclear waste and cleanup of c ontaminated nuclear weapons

environmental management clea nup reform account this amount is approximately 100 million less than the ad ministrations ame nded request of 11 billion however congress chose not appr opriate any funding for this account in the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2003 as discussed on page 24 as noted earlier the administra tion had requested funding for this account to support new initiative that would accelerat cleanup schedules and reduce costs although there have been longstanding c oncerns over the pace and cost of cleanup at defense nuclear waste sites some members of congress criticized doe for not providing adequate information on how the goals of accelerated cleanup and lowered costs would be achieved under this initiativ there also were concerns regarding how these goals could be attained without weakening cleanup standards or other environmental protections while congress chose not to appropria any funding for the newly authorized account primarily due to the above concerns appropriations were increased for the existing defense environmental restoration and waste management account to support efforts at sites where doe had alread

did not complete action on fy2003 appropriations for does management and c leanup of defense nuclear waste final appropriations for these activities were enacted early in the 108thcongress under the consolidated appropriations resolutio n for fy2003 pl 1087 hjres 2 defenserelated environmental provisions in each law are examined below department of defense the department of defense appropria

dods other environmental activ ities including compliance pollution prevention conservation and environmen tal technology as discussed earlier dod determined its fy2003 budget for these pr ograms mostly from funds appropriated to the accounts for operation and mainte nance procurement and research and development pl 107248 provided total of 131 billio n for the cleanup of environmental

of the air force reserve until the secretary of the air force certifies to congress that certain conditions are met among these conditions are the requirement th at any new aircraft assigned to the unit must comply with local environmental and noise standards the law does not include two environmental provisions that were considered during the debate over hr 5010 first the law does not include the senate provision that would have provided up to 25 million to dispose of sediments at inland sites from dredging operations at earle naval station in new jersey sediments from dredging operations are typically disposed of in the ocean due to the comparatively high costs of inland disposal interest in inland disposal has been rising due to concerns over the potentially adverse effects of ocean disposal on coastal water quality second the law does not include the house provision that would have established commission to assess the adverse impacts of encroachment factors including environmental requirements on military training military construction the military constructio n appropriations act for fy2003 pl 107249 hr 5011 allocated 561 million to the brac account for base realignment and closure activities in the united states 4 million s than the enacted authorization of 565 million and about 72 million less than the fy2002 enacted appropriation of 633 million the administration had requested 545 million funding under this account includes support for the cleanup of nvironmental contamination in order to prepare these properties for transfer to ot her uses of the enacted appropriation of 561 million 20 million was reserved for new environmental cleanup acceleration initiative to address the backlog of environmental remediation requirements that have not been met the funding for the initiative was to be allocated accordingly 11 million to the navy 6 million to the air force and 3 million to the army as in fy2002 the law does not place limitation on how much funding can be spent on environmental cleanup prior t fy2002 congress had traditionally placed limitation on environmental c leanup funding under the brac account the departure from this practice is intended to provide dod with greater flexibility in allocating funding for cleanup needs for fy2003 dod allocated 540 million for environmental cleanup from the available appropriation of 561 million for the brac account which is about 69 million less than the amount of 609 million allocated from the fy2002 brac appropria tion of 633 million related to cleanup funding the law directs dod to accurately reflect the anticipated costs of environmental restoration waste management and compliance activities in future budget requests for base closure activities this provision was included to addresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31456crs24 the issue of funding needs for environmenta l activities that dod had not adequately identified in previous budget submissions in addition to specifying funding for base closure activities the law includes provision which provides greater flexib ility for the payment of environmental cleanup costs associated with the upkeep of certain types of military housing the law limits the cost of maintaining and repairing general and flag officer quarters to 35000 per unit annually unless congress is notified 30 days in advance that costs will exceed this amount however if the additional costs are solely for environmental cleanup activities that could not be reasonably anticipated at the time of the budget submission the law authorizes dod to notify congress of the additional costs afterthefact providing an exception from early notification requirements for unforseen environmenta l costs could help to ensure that cost limitations do not prevent dod from taking timely action to comply with requirements to remove hazardous materi als or reduce the threat of exposure energy and water development the consolidated appropriations reso

account 113 b illion was set aside for the defense facilities closure projects account and the remaining 157 million was reserved for the defense environmental management privatization account as discussed earlier congress did not appropriate any funding for does proposed environmental management c leanup reform account which was authorized in the national defense authorization act for fy2003 instead congress increased funding for the existing defense environmental restoration and waste management account by 926 million above th administrations request of 454 billion in order to honor the letters of in tent to accelerate cleanup that doe had already signed with epa and state regulators the increase was to be allocated according to the existing structure of site categories within the account manyconcerns were raised about the administrations cleanup reform initiative during the fy2003 appropria tions debate doe would have budgeted the majority of the funding for the proposed account by decreasing support for cleanup at sites that are funded under the defense environmental restoration and waste management account under this approach funding woul d have been restored at these sites only if compliance agreements with epa and the states were renegotiated to accelerate cleanup schedules and project milestones doe contends that many of the require ments under its
