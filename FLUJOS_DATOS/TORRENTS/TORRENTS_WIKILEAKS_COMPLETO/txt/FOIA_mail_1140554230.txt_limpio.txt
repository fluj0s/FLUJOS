philipbrohanmetofficecom simontettmetofficecom thanks tim am working my way through the comments have also reread mike evans 2002 paper i am frustrated with the associate editors comments he seems to be overtly defending mikes reconstruction which are quite different in nature ie he reconstructed 2 spatial fields the 1st being enso related and the 2nd being probably related to the pdo although it is not clear form the text the coral datasets are also quite different with only 4 series being common to both studies in fact many of the coral series used by mike did not pass my screening process lastly the only statistic use by mike for validation is the correlation coefficient i like to think i have been little more robust at least in this regard i need to diplomatically word all this i never wanted to criticise mikes work in anyway way it was for that reason that i made little mention to it initially anyway i hope to get more cleaner version done by early next week will keep you all posted rob ps do you have the fortran code for ed cooks ssa software original message from 1tim osborn to 2rob wilson 3sandytudhopeedacuk cc 4kbriffaueaacuk 5brohan philip 6simontettmetofficecom sent tuesday february 21 2006 300 pm subject re fw 2005jc003188r decision letter hi rob et seems like there are many points to address some reasonable some rather picky some easy things to do change all time scales to annual to centennial time scales minor inconsistencies pointed out near the end the comments get bit pickystupid eg according to ce reconstruction is less skillful than climatology doesnt re assume climatology calibration period mean while ce compares the skill against the assumption that the mean over the verification period is known which of course it isnt known for general period outside the instrumental period and i really dont think your average reader will be confused into thinking that you calibrated using observations before 1840 though wording could be changed to the explained variance of the reconstruction using records available before 1840 us quite low or something similar that fits the flow of the sentence also earlier on isnt it obvious from the editors own description of the method that you can indeed estimate verification errors for all nests including those available during the instrumental period and thus it is obvious why verification statistics can cover this entire period in figure 2cd the editor just needs to think about things bit more the description of the calibration method can be written in the way that is requested im sure the difficulty is actually in countering the criticisms that 1 the reconstruction error obtained by regression may longer be appropriate after the inflation step 2 the use of calibration period residuals rather than verification period residuals to provide the error bars though here the editor contradicts this suggestion by pointing out that the verification errors apply to period other than the verification period but if you assume the same for the calibration errors then where can you get the errors from hope these quick comments help cheers tim at 1141 18022006 rob wilson wrote greetings all have just been away for week to return to this reply from jgr have only gone through it quickly but we obviously have fussy associate editor to please should have gone for atmospheres rather than oceans will go through it properly on monday hope you are around over the next few days or so regards rob ps have used this email address as the uni server seems to be down original message from

letter dear dr wilson thank you for submitting your manuscript 250years of reconstructed and modeled tropical temperatures paper 2005jc003188r i am in agreement with the associate editor and the reviewers that your revisions fail to adequately address the original concerns about the reconstruction methodologies if you want to convey that this is somehow far superior to earlier reconstructions of sst then it is only fair that readers of jgr get very very clear description of the methods used and convincing argument as to why the reconstruction is better than prior published reports on such reconstructions please heed the detailed comments and carefully address each of the comments with appropriate revisions and clear responses i will be obliged to reject the manuscript if you do not address these concerns since the main claim of an improved reconstruction of historic temperatures is not scientifically rigorous enough for publication in jgroceans please submit your revised manuscript by march 28 2006 if you do not plan to submit revision or if you cannot do so in the time allotted i would be grateful if you could let know as soon as possible please review the important

addressed many of the reviewers remarks and requests for revisions however there are significant outstanding issues detailed below the paper needs thorough revision to become acceptable 1 the paper lacks clear description of the reconstruction technique from the text figures tables and the authors responses one can guess that the following approach was used in order to produce the main full period reconstruction that the authors use for model comparison and interpretation 1 for each year before 1870 the subset of coral records for which this years value is available nest is identified 2 standardized values of the nest records are averaged together for each year for which the entire nest is available 3 linear regression of the nest values is performed on the instrumental annual tropical sst averages for the period 18971981 or its subperiod for which the nest values are available 4 the obtained linear regression formula for that nest is tested on the period 18701896 and the verification statistics is derived 5 the reconstruction of the target year is performed using the same linear regression for this nest and the verification statistics is attributed to this year very small percentage of the readers will be able to understand this procedure from the paper in its current form there are few reasons for that the paper lacks an explicit coherent description of this procedure b the additional inflation of the reconstruction p9 lines 23 is performed but neither the explicit formula for it is given nor how this inflation affects the reconstruction error in verification is discussed c it would seem natural to use the verification error for the error bars but it appears that the authors are using the calibration error although adequate description is given d the authors are taking lot of liberty with using verification statistics unlike error bar estimates these are not supposed to be attributed to the periods other than those for which they were computed or at least it is highly unusual to do that what values are given as coral reconstructions for the instrumental period is not explained calibration values for corresponding nests f why verification statistics in fig 2cd cover the entire calibration period is unclear g the presence of the specific calibration formula in the upper right corner of fig 2 is very confusing in the context of this work but the authors failed to take any action despite the hint from reviewer 2 remark 33 the authors have to provide an unambigous description of all aspects of their reconstruction procedure but all additional information they provide about their reconstruction should help the reader to understand the main message rather than to get confused or completely drowned under the confusing information flow therefore the splitperiod calibrations need to be reported only if they help to deliver the main message which is not the case in the present version same with statistics lot of it is reported but what purpose it serves is unclear all statistics more complicated than correlation coefficient needs to be explicitly defined to make the presentation unambigous in their reply the authors call durbinwatson statistic standard well its not for jgroceans where at least since 1994 its never been used in the entire body of all agu journals it was only about 15 times same with sign test the readers of jgroceans should not be expected to have dendroclimatological textbooks by cook and kairiukstis or by fritts in their posesion in order to look up and interpret the authors results some of these statistics are only introduced in table captions and in puzzling way eg table 2a lines 34 lin r correlation of linear trend in residual series what is meant here is probably the correlationcoefficient of residual with the time variable but in any case lin r is not good notation 2 the authors resisted the gentle insistence of reviewer 2 remark 51 on quantifying the role of trends in the modelreconstruction intercomparison to put it more bluntly the significant correlations reported on p11 and table 3 are only significant because of the long term trends if the 50 or 100year the trends were subtracted significant correlation of residuals would be left trends themselves have such small numbers of degrees of freedom 6 if separate trends are computed for 50 yr periods that reported correlations are not significant for them therefore the authors claim in conclusions of strong mutual agreement between the reconstruction and two global coupledclimate models p14 lines 2122 is not properly supported by the presented results and most likely incorrect the authors have to change somehow their line of argument about modeldata consistency to make it correct and acceptable for publication 3 the authors claim to develop first coralbased large scale temperature reconstruction exclusive to the tropics that represents past sst variability at all timescales first how can it possibly do this at all timescales and what scales other reconstructions of similar length exclude second why evans et 2002 reconstruction doesnt count in general the authors seem to operate with understanding that their reconstruction is superior to that by evans et 2002 eg their reply to remark 34 by reviewer 2 the basis for that is unclear since they use simpler technique simlar coral data set and they only try to reconstruct the tropical mean rather than the entire field the actual advantages of their product compared with earlier works need to be made clear in the paper 4 the revision seems to have been made in great haste so that the changes the authors made often result in inconsistencies with the surrounding text abstract lines 1416 this sentence is grammatically incorrect p4 line 15 raw records are not data transforms p4 lines 1819 and p5 lines 1112 are in conflict logical way to present the material is to say that 16 records passed the screening but then 2 of them were excluded for that and this reason p6 line 7 mta is mentioned here but it is only in the captions to table 2 that it is explained that mta is combined mean of mai and tar this is inappropriate use of caption not to mention that 1 tar is called maitar in the table header 2 the number of records is reduced to 13 now to confuse the reader further p 7 line 6 add here after was used to break the false attribution of this sentence to evans et 1998 work p8 line 5 st abbreviation intoduced earlier is not used here p8 lines 911 calculated used twice p8 line 20 p9 line 5 ambigous confusing description of the crucial part of the procedure p9 lines 618 1 attribution of the statistics to the entire nest record creates very bad effects here prior to 1840 the explained calibration vatiance is quite low for reader who hasnt internalize the authors approach the reference to calibration before 1840 will be shocking 2 strictly speaking for the entire period before 1850 the reconstruction has less skill than climatology according to ce in the figure 2b the authors have to deal with complicated task of explaining that to the reader while also arguing that since after 1750 the ce is bit better that before 1750 they chose to use the reconstruction after 1750 for comparison with the models the reviewer 1 was concerned about this too in the first remark p9 line 19 appear improved compared to what p15 lines 1921 again it needs to be explained better what is the contribution of the present paper to evaluating the potential for reconstructing large scale tropical temperatures from network of coral proxies as compared to evans et papers where this task seems to have been accomplished before from few different angles p24 line 1 simple zero order ols regression is not simple what does zero order mean in this context p24 line 5 model residual is confusing because the only models called so in the paper are gcms but here model denotes linear regression model page 41 table s1 1 it would be helpful to explain that left part of these tables are calibration statistics and right are verification statistics 2 what is ar2 multiple correlation coefficient is r different from r 3 why fullperiod verification statistics are missing for nests after 1879 dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich
