make the following statement i am witness to the events preceding the homicide of scarlett eden keeling british national on the morning of the 18th february 2008 i arrived in goa on the 1st feb 2008 and was invited to stay as guest of samson dsouza and his wife cecile i had been acquainted with mrsamson dsouza since first meeting him in anjuna in 2002 on the evening of 17th feb 2008 i accompanied mr samson dsouza to luiss cafe at between 830 and 9 pm i was at the shack until approximately 5 am the next morning that evening i consumed one beer several glasses of juice and lots of water i restricted my alcohol as i was on antibiotics at approximately 3 am i saw girl of european appearance falling over in front of luiss cafe on the sand luis couthino the owner of the shack was on the beach at the time mr couthino helped the girl into the shack she was wearing red vest kind of top and blue shorts with italia written behind them in the shack at the time were myself mr dsouza luis couthino local man by the name of shanna and an indian man by the name of mooly i am unsure of spelling who i believe was an employee of curlys beach shack there was also british young man by the name of charlie but i believe he may have arrived at the shack after the young girl arrived i heard her talking to luis and i overheard the young girl identifying herself as scarlett she said she had money to get home with taxi as she was living in siolim i suggested to those present in the bar that we organize taxi for her and i offered to pay for it but this suggestion was ignored she appeared to be very intoxicated and was walking in uncoordinated manner she stayed at the luis cafe for the next two hours or so scarlett went into the kitchen area of the shack where three indian men shanna luis couthino and mooly were sitting talking i was sitting at the bar talking to mr samson dsouza and charlie scarlett stayed in the kitchen area which is at the back of the cafe for approximately an hour she then came to the bar and began talking to and samson dsouza her speech was incoherent but i could gather that she was from england and 15 years of age at approximately 415 am scarlett returned to the kitchen area of the shack where luis couthino shanna and mooly were still present at approximately 5 am mooly said he would escort scarlett back to curlys and assured she would be safe and left luiss with her shanna was now at the bar talking to at approximately 5 min later i noticed samson dsouza had also left the shack i went to the parking area to urinate at that point i saw mooly driving away on his scooter in the beam of his headlight i saw samson dsouza on top of scarlett they were both fully clothed it appeared that samson dsouza was trying to remove scarletts clothes i was shocked and appalled because despite my informing samson dsouza and the others in the shack that the girl was minor he was assaulting her i was shacked and scared knew samson and mooly were local men and could have physically assaulted i did not have the strength to physically confront them i got on my scooter and drove away but i was feeling rage at their actions against minor girl i drove 400500 meters down the road heading away from the beach opposite marios bar near antonios wine shop and near 6 pack restaurant i saw man standing in the road talking on his mobile phone i stopped my scooter and recognized the man was mooly i verbally confronted him and reprimanded him strongly for not having looked after scarlett despite his assurance to escort her safely to curlys shack disgusted and in rage but feeling helpless i then drove back to samson dsouzas house the door was locked and i did not have key to get in at approximately 530 am i drove to starco junction to purchase packet of cigarettes at the 24 hour shop where i saw shanna shanna inquired about scarlett but i was too enraged to reply to any of his probes i then returned to samson dsouzas house and waited for him to return with the key at approximately 6 am samson dsouza returned home he opened the door for both of us there were exchange of words between us i went straight to my room i woke up at approximately 11am and went to an std booth in north anjuna to call my ex partner in britain to tell her what id seen the night before i then went to luiss shack where i was informed by menan that young foreign girls body had been found dead close to luiss shack on the beach when someone in the shack mentioned that the girl had piercing in her lower lip i suspected in was scarlett i stayed in the shack for approximately 20 minutes and then returned to the same std in north anjuna and telephoned my ex partner to tell her that the body of young girl fitting scarletts description had been found dead on the beach next to luis shack i was keen to report what i had witnessed to the local police but was afraid for my own life i had been threatened with dire consequences by samson dsouza i remained in anjuna until 23rd feb 2008 when i was informed that samson dsouza and the police of anjuna were looking for i then called the british deputy high commission in mumbai they informed that they could not interfere in local judicial proceedings in fear of being killed in case i deposed on the matter i kept my distance from the people who i feared could kill on the public statements of the goa police that they would ensure my safety i have now come forward to make this statement this statement has been made on my own accord free will and without any coercion by the police michael anthony mannion
