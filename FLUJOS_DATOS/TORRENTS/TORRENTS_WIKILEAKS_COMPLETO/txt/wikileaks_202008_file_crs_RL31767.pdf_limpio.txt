and international initiatives summary international child labor has become an increasingly important issue in discussions concerning inte rnational trade human rights and foreign aid while number of international national and local initiatives seek to abolish the practice there continues to be debate on what constitutes child labor some consider any work undertaken by children to be child labor while others may use the term to refer to work under abusive conditions the in ternational labor organization ilo defines child labor as form of work that is inherently hazardous employs children below the internationally recognized minimum age or is exploitative child labor is used in this report as defined by the ilo according to the ilo about 246 million children were engaged in child labor in 2000 some 186 million child laborers were below the age of 15 and approximately 110 million were below the age of 12 while awareness of the issue has increased the ability to address the complex problem has been complicated by numbe r of related issues including rising poverty surging hivaids infection rates and lack of relevant education news stories have featured children working in ex port industries such as textiles clothing carpets and footwear and cau sed international uproar while the news stories have contributed to heightened awareness about the problem of inte rnational child labor the ilo has found that child workers in export industries are relatively few compared to those employed in activ ities geared to domestic consumption congressional support for the abolition of international child labor particularly the worst forms of child labor is very strong congress has funded programs to combat international child labor initiated bills that expand the united states role in the global fight against child labor and included clauses that require action on eliminating child labor in international trade agreem ents although congress has consistently boosted american efforts to eliminate child labor worldwide there are number of issues that continue to impede these efforts including ineffective enforcement mechanisms sparse monitoring systems and insufficient funding for programs that alleviate pove rty decrease incidences of hivaids and increase access to relevant education this report will discuss the ilo definition of child labor outline the scope of

programs and present some issues congress may consider child labor is term that is used in number of ways some use it to describe any work undertaken by children while others use the term to refer to abusive work the international labor organization ilo1 defines child labor as form of work that is inherently hazardous employs ch ildren below the internationally recognized minimum age2 or is

the ilo collects data on child labor and children in economic activity because it often serves as proxy quantifier for child labor3 children in economic activity encompasses all children engaged in work including child laborers experts believe it is critical to collect this data because many governments do not collect employment data on those below their min imum working age consequently data on

however subsaha ran africa is estimated to have the highest proportion of working children w ith nearly 30 of its children engaged in some form of economic activity about one in three children below the age of 15 is economically active in the region6 the child work ratios in other major world regions are all projected to be below 20 percent7 furthermore every fourth child in subsaharan africa appears to start work before the age of 108 africas relatively high poverty rate as well as its relatively high proportion of individuals both residing and employed in rural areas may contribute to the large number of children at work according to world bank report child labor participation rates are much higher in rural than in urban areas and threequarters of working children work in family enterprises9 the report further emphasizes that child labor is and will continue to be common in large number of countries until poverty is substantially reduced the ilo estimates that nearly half 485 of all economically active children were engaged in hazardous work which it defines as any activity or occupation which by its nature or type has or leads to adverse effects on the childs safety health and moral development10 much agricultural work is included in this category because it may involve the use of heavy machinery or exposure to pesticides an ilo report concluded that 55 of children below 12 years of age were working in hazardous occupation or situation in 2000 children between 12 years old and 14 years old were the largest age group working in hazardous occupation or situation sixtysix percen t of all child laborers aged 12 through 14 were reported to be enga ged in hazardous work11 the ilo chart below delineates the activity of those engaged in child labor who comprise nearly 70 of all economically active children an overwhelming majority 695 of these child laborers is engaged in hazardous work the deceptively small percentage of child laborers 34 engage d

been complicated by range of factors including poverty lack of access to education soaring hivaids rates and the ability to conceal the use of child labor historically povert and child labor are inextricably linked families in many count ries rely on the income from children to cover basic needs world bank report f ound that countries with per capita income of 500 or less at 1987 prices have labor force participa tion rates of 3060 for children aged 1014 years in contrast w ealthier developing c ountries with incomes between 500 and 1000 have lowe r child labor participati on rates at

suppresses wages because it increases the total labor suppl recent article from the journal of international affairs argues that if child labor is left to pr oliferate adult labor could be threatened in the same measure as females replaced men as factory workers so child labor if not restricted will crow d proportionate number of dults out of employment17 child labor in the shadows children working in export industries suc h as textiles clothing carpets and footwear have been featured on news stor ies causing international uproar an nbc dateline report recently highlighted the grim side of child labor in story aired on june 23 2002 the news story entitled slaves to fashion child labor and abuse in indian silk factories showed children working in dirty sweltering factories with blaring music to fight fatigue running water toilets and place to rest it reported that these children lived and worked in factories whose internal temperature often exceeded 100 degrees and which remain ed locked with armed guards barring entrance or exit many of the factories were in back alleys accessible only to those that worked in them hidden cameras showed children picking silk out of boiling pots with their bare hands standing at machines purposely built for them and cowering as abusive employers liberally hit or threatened them research has indicated that children more often work in small subcontracting shops like these or homework situations rather than in largescale formal factories18 an important part of the story was segment that showed the difficulty in monitoring and tracking goods produced with child labor an undercover news reporter held an extensive interview with silk exporter who admitted that her company routinely sends its silk to italy to receive an italia n label minimizing the likelihood that her company would be scru tinized for child labor practices and guaranteeing higher price for the goods19 this practice reveals the difficulty in abolishing child labor as companies c ontinue to discover ways to circumvent monitoring systems child labor in various industries the dateline story raised awareness about some aspects of child labor however the

the argument that child labor needs to be addressed at the nati onal and local levels surveys have revealed that the majority of children who work 70 are engaged in agriculture with less than 9 involve d in manufacturing trade and restaurant work only 65 were found to be engaged in social and personal services including domestic work some 4 worked in tran sport storage and communications and 3 were found to be involved in construction mining and quarrying21 not only were most children found to be engaged in agri cultural work but most children were also found in the informal sector this mean s that children will be less likely found in highly organized commercial plantations nonetheless children are still significant portion of the commercial agricultural workfo rce because the large plantations often subcontract to smallscale family farms that may use child labor studies in brazil kenya and mexico have shown that ch ildren under 15 make up between 25 and 30 of the total labor force in production of various commodities22 the common practice of subcontracting is mirrored in manufacturing and host of other industries underscoring the importance of developing national programs that address poverty access to basic education and include ch ild labor initiatives in national labor legislation child labor and hivaids child labor has become even more difficult to eliminate with the rapid spread of hivaids hivaids increases the numbe r of child orphans and street children inhibits childrens ability to regularly ttend school makes child ren more vulnerable to sexual abuse and prostitu tion and ultimately elevates the demand for child labor hivaids has already increased th number of child orphans before hivaids about 2 of children in the veloping world were orphans by the end of the 1990s about 10 of children were or phans in some countries an estimated 13 million children have lost their mothers or both parents to hivaids and 27 million children are expected to be affect ed by hivaids by 2010 if children up to 18 years are considered children up to 15 years old are traditionally considered orphans 50 million children will be aff ected by hivaids by 2010 globally at least 90 of those orphaned through hivaids live in subsaharan africa23 children orphaned by hivaids often ve less access to education research has shown that children orphaned by hivai ds

school either to care for the ill parents and siblings or to find work to substitute for the income of the sick or deceased parent even if they remain in school children rais ed in households with parent living with hivaids usually only ttend school sporadically once the parents dies the child may find refuge in the streets or with an extended family member the extended family network has traditionally been very strong in many developing countries ho wever hivaids is undermining it older family members already struggling to make living rarely have enough money to sufficiently care for additional children these children are less likely to receive an education are more likely to be mal nourished and are more easily exploited extended families are turning away children at rising rates resulting in significant increase in street children and working children children on the street in need of money food shelter and guidance are more likely to be drawn into causal sexual relationships or to be exploited for comme rcial sexual practices consequently these children become more likely to contract hivaids themselves the united nations estimates that up to 48 of street children have been sexually abused in return for food and shelter25 as working adults continue to die at rapid rates the demand for child labor increases in areas severely affected by hivaids employers have begun to seek out children to fill in the labor gaps in zimbabwe the hiv induced loss of adult labor on commercial agricultural estates has increased the demand for child labor both in fields and in households in sout h africa children are expected to work on the estate if they live with their parents on the compound26 child labor and education lack of access to education is yet another contributor to the persistence of child labor education is critical in both preven ting child labor and in removing children from hazardous forms of work an estimated 113 million children do not have access to primary education around the world27 some do not have access to education because the school fees uniform s and other related expenses are out of reach others either do not have access to school or do not find the education offered to be relevant to their need s while child labor may supplement the household income in the shortterm in th longterm it can plunge the family deeper into poverty as it both increases the likelihood that the child will receive meager wages for hisher lifetime nd suppresses adult wages httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31767crs9 28 additional international

establish mechanisms to provide incountry ownership and operation of national programs create awareness about child labor in communities and workplaces and enhance workplace monitoring and social protection programs38 second technical assistance initiative is the time bound programs tbp the tbp seeks to assist member states to implement convention 182 and eradicate the worst forms of child labor within five to ten years the ilo expects tbps to have significant impact on sustainable deve lopment largely because its methodology incorporates all members of society and because it requires that states demonstrate commitment to eradicating the worst forms of child labor recognizing the link between poverty and child labor tbps seek to incorporate strategies for the abolition of the worst

child labor worldwide proponents of these effort s say that number of issues continue to complicate these initiatives including ineffective enforcement mechanisms sparse monitoring systems and insuffici ent funding for programs that alleviate poverty decrease incidences of hivaids and increase access to relevant education some argue that until international enforcement mechanisms are established global monitoring systems are enha nced and funding for prog rams that combat poverty hivaids and illiteracy are boosted child labor will continue to flourish lack of enforcem ent mechanisms there are number of international na tional and local programs that seek to eliminate international child labor some argue that lack of enforcement mechanisms diminishes the impact of these programs69 ratification of ilohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31767crs18 69 continued debate has been captured in congressional hearings and briefings including federal news service fns usia foreign press

international trade and child labor journal of economic issues v29 n2 june 1995 p419 71 the united states has not ratified number of ilo conventions because it argues that it infringes on national and

institute cato trade briefing paper 10 june 20 2000 p16conventions and participation in the ilo international child labor programs are voluntary some maintain that the ilo should have some form of enforcement capacity or penalty mechanisms in place to strengthen the child labor conventions these arguments have raised number of questions including whether the ilo should add enforcement mechanisms to its charter and the impact that enforcement mechanisms could have on ilo membersh ip there are 186 ilo member states some have also suggested that the ilo should allow countries to file grievances against countries that consistently use child labor linking child labor to international trade and foreign aid some argue that linking child labor to international trade strengthens efforts to eliminate its use advocates of this practi ce argue that countries that use child labor create unemployment in developed countries as multinational companies move their plants to countries with lower labor cost s this they argue constitutes social dumping term that implies that deve loping countries without adequate labor standards distort trade and investment flows and participate in unfair competition70 additionally supporters of using trade as tool to discourage the use of child labor maintain that this linkage will help veloping countries to modernize because children will be forced to attend school and in the long run more educated workforce will boost the countrys productive potential others oppose marrying child labor and international trade for number of reasons first they argue that the united states unjustly requires states to ratify or comply with international child labor conventions which it has not ratified71 second opponents argue that heightened tr ade barriers will worsen the plight of workers and more than likely increase reliance on child labor as growth is halted and families struggle to contend with increased poverty finally since most child labor occurs on family farms and in the informal sector trade initiatives will have only minimal impact on child laborers opponents argue if the united states would reduce its trade barriers such as tariffs on foreign textiles and agriculture some argue developing countries would be able to grow fight poverty and minimize their reliance on child laborers72 this issue has spurred bates on number of issues including whether the united states should c ontinue to use international trade forums to contribute to the abolition of international child labor another issue some havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31767crs19 73 see unicef beyond child labor affirming rights new york unicef march 2001raised is whether us tariffs and subsidies indirectly contribute to international child labor opponents of the use of us tariffs and subsidies have argued that the united states might be able to offer tradefrie ndly options to eliminate child labor such as halting direct foreign aid payments to governments that use child labor lack of global monitoring systems both the ilo and the united states trai n labor monitors in foreign countries however most labor monito ring activities are undertaken in the formal sector as noted early in this report most forms of international child labor occur in the informal sector such as family farms and home businesses count ries that already struggle with insufficient numbers of labor monitors who are often illtrained and ill equipped can not effectively monitor the informal sector advocates of the increased use of labor monitors have debated whether the united states should encourage the ilo to train labor monitors to inspect labor practices in the informal sector others have suggested that the ilo could offer governments additional technical assistance to hire more labor monitors some argu that alternative thods of supporting labor monitors such as encouraging the privat sector or nongovernmental organizations to offer suppo rt to incountry labor monitors or the ilo in monitoring and documenting child labor abuses child labor as development issue some have maintained th at funding for poverty alle viation hivaids basic education and agriculture is insuffici ent these observers argue that comprehensive antichild labor agenda s hould include increased funding for poverty reduction programs education initiatives and other development programs they maintain that if child labor were approached from human rights perspective then the myriad of development issues would be addressed in conjunc tion with child labor programs73 those who see child labor as velopment issue argu that countries including the united states should increase funding to other development programs such as hivaids basic edu cation and agriculture othe rs express concern that if the united states were to increase its f unding to antipoverty initiatives it might have to cut funding for other programs at the same time some argue that the united states needs to change the way it offers foreign aid overall httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31767crs20 74 ilo future without child labor global report under the followup to
