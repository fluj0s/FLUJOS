nonconfiscatory and the legislative purposes of the statute were compelling it is likely that the fee cap would not violate the takings clause if however the reduction in lawyer s compensa tion were severe and the legislative purpose were seen as less tha n compelling an unconstitutional taking might well be discerned as for the federalism issue there is series of vacillating supreme cour t decisions respecting the power of congress to regulate the states as states thes decisions at least for the moment are apparently inconsistent with each other so it is impossible to pr edict which

establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrationa l way3 in another case the court held that due process requirements could be t simply by showing that the retroactive application

cap could be held to take property under the fifth amendments takings clause under current takings case law 7 however it seems that taking would be found only if the cap effected rathe r substantial reduction in the compensation that would otherwise have been owed for such work performed and was unaccompanied by other provisions that conferre d offsetting benefits on the affected attorneys the essential prerequisite to any taking claim is the plaintiffs demonstratio n that he or she po ssesses property right cognizable by the takings clause as of the date of the alleged taking contract rights are generally deemed to be property so8 this hurdle is met here we assume valid contracts promising the states attorneys some precisely ascertainable amount of compensation for their legal work

contrasted with land us cases whi ch form the mainstream of takings law phrase used in both the mmpa decisions is particularly revealin g the court noted that having found substantive due process violation i n those cases it would be surprising indeed to discover that taking h ad occurred because the court virtually never finds substantive du e12 process violation on the basis of economic regulation this statement has been taken to mean it would be similarly hesitant to find taking in that realm economi c regulation is generally viewed as merely adjusting the benefits and burdens f economic life to promote the common good and unde r our cases does not constitute taking and indeed the supreme court has never found taking based on13 federal legislative alteration of existing private contracts note quite critically that the mmpa cases and the lawyers fee cap proposal do not involve the united states seeking to abroga its own contracts situation entitled to m uch less deference because of the governments selfinterest owing to such lowered deference us government abrogations of its own contracts fo r reasons of selfenrichment rather than furtherance of broad public

united states own use another factor cutting against taking16 more specifically governmenta l restraints on wages prices rents and common carrier rates have usually been upheld against taking challenge17 but while economic regulation generally appears to hold little interest to th courts as taking ther is potentially significant distinction between the attorneys fee cap and the facts involved in the surveyed cases to date none of these case s appeared to involve statute that excused or partia lly excused contract party from duty 1 stated in preexisting c ontract in nonheavily regulated field attorneyshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs5 fees 2 reducible to precise dollar amount 3 to pay for work already performed this fact counsels against cavalierly applying to the proposed fee cap the genera l handsoff approach of the court to federal modification of existing private contracts in light of the above the soundest argument seems to be that if the effect of lawyers fee cap were to deprive an attorney of only moderate portion of what he or she would otherwise receive the reduced amount was reasonable r nonconfiscatory and the legislative purposes recited in the statute wer compell ing it is quite likely that the fee cap would be seen as inoffensive to th takings clause if on the other hand the reduct ion in lawyers compensation were severe and the legislative purposes seen as less than compelling taking might well be discerned i n the latter circumstance it is difficult to regard the legislative action as but another legislative adjustment of the benefits and burdens of economi c life nor do w understand the fee cap proposal to offer the affected attorneys any offsetting benefits the federalism issues this section addr esses the question whether there is substantial constitutional argument base d on federalism concerns that could be made against proposals to cap or to require the states to cap the attorneys fees to be paid lawyers retained by the states to pursue litigation against the tobacco companies various proposals were offered and debated in 1997 with the greatest advance contained in amendments to the laborhhs appropriations bill briefly the bill was amended in the senate to cap attorneys fees but it was further amended so as not to apply to already existing fee agreements other legislation one approach bein g exemplified by the bill by senator hatch s 1530 which as part of an overal l enactment of the settlement between the states and the tobacco companies woul d mandate an arbitration panel to fix attorneys fees and others exemplified by s 1570 by nator faircloth briefly this latter bill would cap attorneys fees at 125 per hour in connection with the june 20 1997 sett lement agreement or other actions involving suits to recover medicaid expenditures deemed to have been paid out as result of smoking disabilities there is series of vacillating supreme court decisions respecting the powers of congress to regulate the states as states because the dec isions are not at least for the moment consistent one with another it is not possible to make definitiv statement that the amendment would be invalidated if it were enacted and judicially challenged but inasmuch as discernable trend may be observed in the decision s and because the mo re recent decisions may be determinative of the issue we believe that serious and perhaps successful challenge to the constitutionality of th amendment can be predicted challenge to the amendment would be on the basis that congress is regulating state conduct that it cannot regulate the contention is not that congress lacks th legislative jurisdiction to impose such regulation generally the commerce clause art i 8 cl 3 being more than adequate to provide the foundation but tha t congressional power c annot be so extended to require the states to do something or to prohibit the states from doing something that falls within traditional stat ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs6 functions c onducting litigation to obtain obligations owed to them and either using their own counsels or retaining privat attorneys to litigate concomitantly with being able freely to contract with private attorneys the amount of their fees is cor traditional state function an arguable approa ch to successful constitutional result may be for congress to tie statute capping attorneys fees to legislation needed to approve last year s settlement the contention that since congress may in its discretion act or refuse t act it may condition its action on the states agreeing to the cap the commerce clause basis preliminarily one must ask whether congress has legislative jurisdiction upon which to base legislation capping the fees that states agree to pay attorneys the obvious basis is the commerce clause article i 8 cl 3 which empowers congress to regulate commerce among the several states it i s well settled that cong ress pursuant to this clause can regulate intrastate activities or conduct that does not cross state lines but that substantially affects interstat commerce even activity that is purely intrastate in character may be regulated b congress where the activity combined with l ike conduct by others similarly situated affects commerce among the states or with foreign nations fry v united states 421 us 542 547 1975 the sweep of the power is illustrated by the doctrine of aggregation that is the activities of all individual parties are considered together for the purpose of determining ffect eg perez v united states 402 us 146 1971 summ it health ltd v pinhas 500 us 322 1991 and by the limited scope f judicial review courts do not attempt for themselves to determine whether there is an effect and whether it is substantial the courts rather seek to determine whether congress could r ationally conclude that there was substantial effect court may invalidate legislation enac ted under the commerce clause only if it is clear that there is ratio nal basis for congressional finding that the regulated activity affect s interstate commerce or that there is reasonable connection between the regulatory means selected and the asserted ends hodel v indiana 452 us 314 3232 4 1981 see also hodel v virginia surface mining reclamation assn 452 us 264 281 1981 preseault v icc 494 us 1 17 1990 change in the doctrin or standards was effected in united states v lopez 514 us 5 49 1995 in which for the first time since 1936 the court held tha t congress had exceeded its commerce authority in regulating private conduct th decision struck down ban on possession of firearm within 1000 feet of school adopted as floor amendment in the senate the provis ion was subject to hearings and to congressional findings and did not contain any jurisdictional basis requiring determination of an effect on interstate commerce moreover the section was not applied to an activ ity for which it was rational to conclude that each individual piece of conduct could be aggregated to count s whole the case is rare example of an act of congress being found to be irra tional it evidences intent to turn away from half century of jurisprudence see alliedbruce terminix cos v dobson 513 us 265 1995 this impression is stre ngthened by the numerous decisions of the federal courts of appeals since lopez which have overwhelmingly rejected constitutiona lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs7 challenges under the commerce clause to other gun legislation to drug laws carjacking prohibitions and numerous other statutes decisions that the suprem court has declined to review the federalism issue the issue turns thus on whether the constitution bars or does not permit the extension of commerceclause exercise to the states s states ordinarily when it is acting within the powers granted it under th constitution congre ss may impose its will on the states gregory v ashcroft 501 us 452 460 1991 however this is not always the case to explicate the case law on this matter requires b rief history for long periods in our jur isprudence the supreme court followed principle of dual federalism under which the federal government and the states had each an area of jurisdiction that was mutually exclusive of the others authority an exclusivity that was t textual constitutionally but that was exemplified by the tenth amendment beginning in the 1930s however the doctrine of dual federalism fell into desuetude and congress powers were interpreted so that if fair reading of the express an d implied grants contained in the constitution allowed congress to regulate certai n state activities that reading was the correct one without reference to the powers of the states illustrative of this approach was united states v california 297 us 175 1936 in which the court upheld the power of congress to extend railroad safety law to stateowned and operated railroad under the commerce clause th sovereignty of the state was necessarily diminished to the extent of the power s granted to congress for years the kind of federal regulations at issue was directed to the proprietary activities of the states conduct that was also engaged in by private actors such as the operation of railroads but then congre ss began to regulate governmental activities in maryland v wirtz 392 us 183 1968 the court sustained the extension of the federal wage and hour law to nonprofessional employees of state operated school s and hospitals see also fry v united states 421 us 542 1975upholdin g temporary wage and salary controls on all

internal operations by determining the wages and hours of their employees in areas of traditiona l governmental functions was critical and protected were league of cities good law today good argument could be made that congressional cap on attorneys fees would be highly questionable and likely to b held unconstitutional under the doctrinal lines of that case however following period in which efforts to extend it failed the case wa s overruled in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit aut h 469 us 528 1985 also by 5to4 vote do ctrinally the court did two things first it held that federal powers granted by the constitution were not cabined by considerations of stat sovereign ty if power was granted to congress it could be exercised even to th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs8 extent of regulating and limiting state powers second absent an express provision in the stitution protecting them the states recourse against federal actions was to act within the political process and through their c ongressional representatives see also south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988reaffirming and strengthenin g garcia garcia has not been overruled and if it remains good law constitutiona l challenge to congressional cap on statepaid attorneys fees would be problematic doubt exists though that it is goo d law moreover it is not the only law in this field concerns of federalism were reasserted by new majorities in gregory v ashcro ft 501 us 452 1991 in the context of statutory construction purportedly pursued to avoid tenth amendment challenge to federal law in new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 the court held unconstitutional federal w requiring the states to implement and carry out provisions of the lowleve l radioactive waste policy amendments the court purported not to question th validity of garcia saying that the former case was distinguishable because i t involved the application to the states of generally applicable law equally applie d to private parties and the states thus states are not remitted to the political process when federal law is applied solely to them inasmuch as congressional cap would apply only to the states the new york principle rather than the garcia principle prevails states or private partie s aggrieved by the senate amendment asserting states rights could challenge it s constitutionality in court further t he court held that congress lacked the power under the constitution to commandeer state legislative and administrative resources to carry out federa l functions the court did not discern solid textual basis for this conclusion i t observed t hat the federalism question presented ie whether particular sovereign powers have been granted by the constitution to the federal government or hav been retained by the states can be viewed in either f two ways in some cases the court has inquired whether an act of congress is authorized by one of the power s delegated to congress in article i of the constitution in other cases the court has sought to determine whether an act of congress invades the province of stat sovereignty r eserved by the tenth amendment in case like this one involving the division of authority between federal and state governments the two inquiries ar mirror images of each other if power is delegated to congress in the constitution the tenth amendment expressly disclaims any res ervation of that power to the states if power is an attribute of state sovereignty reserved by the tenth amendment it is necessarily power the constitution has not conferred on congress the tenth amendment confirms that the power of the federal government is subject to limits that may in given instance reserve power to the states th tenth amendment thus directs us to determine as in this case whether an incident of state sovereignty is protected by limitation on an article i power id 15557 internal citations omitted congressional cap woul d not commandeer state legislative and administrative resources within the proscription of new york but rather it would regulate stat ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs9 function tr aditional state function new york is not squarely on point and thus it does not directly imp licate the proposals but its interpretative analysis does suggest the substantial burden congressional cap would carry last term the court in another 5to4 decision printz v united states 117 sct 2365 1997 held unconstitutional certain provisions of the brady law tha t required law enforcement officers of the states and local governments to conduc t background checks in order to determine whether applicants to purchase handguns might be disqualified from doing so expressly adverting to the doctrine of dua l federalism id 2376 the court asserted that while constitutional text spoke to the precise issue id 236970 history and practice did and congress could t impose on state and local officers federal duties and compel them to exercise those duties id 237678 in printz the court read its precedents as establishing that the federa l government may not compel the states to implement by legislation or executiv action federal regulatory programs id 2 380 moreover garcia was rejected as an inappropriate precedent because it is the whole object of the brady law to direct the functio ning of the state executive id 2383 the courts statement of it s holding is unyielding we held in new york that congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce federal regulatory program today we hold th at congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the states officers directly the federal governm ent may neither issue directives requiring the states to address particula r problems nor command the states officers or those of their political subdivisions to administer or enforce federal regulatory program it matters not whethe r policymaking is involved and casebycase weighing of the burdens or benefit s is necessary such c ommands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty id 2384 hence although there is square constitutional doctrine on which we ma rely it seems reasonably evident that this court as now constituted would loo k favorably on challenge to congressional cap new york and printz strongl suggest that garcia when it arises in case before the court will be reconsidered and overrule d and that league of cities in some form or another will be reinstated s controlling law as we have indicated above leagu of cities would indicate that the cap would be constitutionally questionable even absent the revival of that case however constitutional doubts exist with respect to the proposals the most recent cases strongly suggest that congress would be held to lack authority to regulate or to restrict the manner in which states structure their litigating authority one must observe that if an nacted cap is challenged in the lower courts those courts must accept garcia as good law until the supreme court overrules it lower courts ma not engage in an anticipatory overruling of case that they may think to be undermined by later precedent cf agostini v felton 117 sct 1997 201 7 1997 but this only means that if the issue turns on the vitality of garcia versus league of cities the matter would have to go to the supreme court however as we have indicated because the politicalprocess doctrine of garcia does not apply federal cap exclusively covering the states lower court could adjudicate th question and might hold that cap would fall under the principle of new york and printz httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs10 that the latter approach may prevail is evidenced by two recent decisions i n federal district courts in which plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of th drivers privacy protection act of 1994 18 usc 272125 that law regulates the dissemination and use of certain information contained in state motor vehicl records addressing congressional perception of problems associated with the active commerce in and the consequent easy availability of personal information contained in such records both courts found that the law in regula ting how states maintain and choose to dissemina motor vehicle records infringed on state sovereignty and was unconsti tutional condon v reno 972 fsupp 977 dsc 1997 oklahoma v united states 1997 us dist lexi s 14455 wdokla sept 17 1997 the point is not whether these two courts are decisionally correct but rather that they chose to approach the issue in the context of new york and printz instead of trying to analyze the statute through the prism of revivified league of cities conditions on federal legislation one possible approach to the avoidance of the constitutional bar to regulation of the states as states is to enact legislatio n conferring benefit on the states conditioned upon their acceptance of federa l provision capping attorneys fees the most common example of this approach is the conditioning of federal spending if state wants to accept the money it must accept the condition see eg south dakota v dole 483 us 203 1987 however in the context of the tobacco settlement resort to money offers need not be the solution federal legislation is necessary to closure of the settlement between the states and the tobacco companies but congress need not act legislation it has discretion to act or not t act thus congress could invoke what has been called the greater power doc trine the principle of which is that if government has the greater power to deny benefit completely or to forbid an activity entirely it cannot be imprope r to confer th benefit or to permit the activity conditionally that is power mus t include its constituent elements or in the parlance of the doctrine thegreater includesthelesser congress in the course of legislating into law the settlement would include the cap on attorneys fees eit her making it clear to the states that the cap is prerequisite to the overall legislati on or going further to require the states expressly to accede to the cap however the greaterpower doctrine has been paralleled for the better part of this century by another doctrine the unconstitutionalconditions doctrine that is governme nt may not utilize discretionary benefit as device to extract fro m someone surrender of constitutional right to illustrate the two doctrines we might point to an early case doyle v continental ins co 94 us 535 1876 in which state was permitted to allow an outofstate corporation into t he state to do business provided the corporation gave up its righ t to bring suit in federal courts under diversity jurisdiction the greate r power of exclusion included the lesser power of admission based upon acceptanc of cond ition condition the state could not have imposed directly however i n frost frost trucking co v railroad comm 271 us 583 1926 the cour t imposed the doctrin of unconstitutional conditions on the exercise of similar state condition in that case the state conditioned the use of the states highways on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs11 acceptance by certain corporations of the duties of common carri ers status the state could not have imposed directly striking down this condition the court declared if the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as condition of its favor it may in like manner compel surrender of all it is inconceivable tha t guaranties embedded in the constitution of the united states may thus b manipulated out of existence id 594 and see terral v b urke const co 257 us 529 1922 one would think that the two d octrines cannot coexist one must supersede the other and yet as we said above both doctrines do exist in parallel tracks on sometim governing case the other governing another case inconsistenc shadows the court in its application of first one then the other reconciliation f precedents in this area is impossible thus the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions has been utilized at times b both wings of the modern court and by its center eg dolan v city of tigard 512 us 374 3 85 1994chief justice rehnquist for the court holding

public funding to presidentia l candidates conditioned on their adherence to these very same expenditures limits id 57 n 65 90109 in lyng v international union uaw 485 us 360 36469 1988 the court rejected an uncons titutional conditions challenge to provisions barring federal food stamps to otherwise eligible households that d become needy bec ause household member was on strike in wyman v james 400 us 309 1971 the court held that the government could legitimately conditio n receipt of afdc on the recipients submission t warrantless inspections of her home to make sure she was complying with the program in rust v sullivan 500 us 173httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs12 1991 the court upheld regulation that provided that federallyfunded famil planning clinics were not among other things to allow their doctors to discus s abortion with pregnant clients in brendale v confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation 492 us 408 43337 1989justice stevens delivering the opinion of the court in part and concurring in part the court held that the tribes power to exclude nonmembers from its reservation which derived from it s aboriginal sovereignty and the express provisions of its treaty with the united states necessarily included the lesser powe r to regulate land use in the interest of protecting the tribal community zoning power the tribe would not otherwise have had because of the co urts failure to promulgate standards as to when the doctrine is applicable and when not not only is the result in any newly arising case rathe r speculative but the stability of precedent is subject to erosion and even t destruction to illustrate in posadas puerto rico assocs v tourism co f puerto rico 478 us 328 1986 the common wealth had licensed casino gambling but because it thought ac cess to the casinos by puerto ricans was economically and socially harmful it barred casinos from advertising to puerto ricans whil encouraging them to advertise to mainlanders both in the united states and i n touristoriented publications within the island it can readily be seen that the issue the right to advertise which is protected to some xtent under the commercialspeech doctrine central hudson gas electric corp v psc 447 us 557 1980 s modified is the same issue raised by ban or regulation on the advertising of tobacco products as contemplated in the tobacco bills the court in an opinion by justic rehnqu ist explicitly found that the advertisements at issue met the test fo r constitutionallyprotected commerc ial speech id 34041 however the court went on to hold that the commonwealth had met its burden under the central hudso n standard by making the showing required furt her justice rehnquist continued prior decisions striking down advertising bans were inapposite inasmuch as those case s concerned advertising of items that were constitutionally protected that was not the case here the puerto rico legislature surely could have prohibited casin gambling by the residents of puerto rico altogether in our view the power t completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ba n advertising of casino gambling id 34546 and see id 346 it is precisel because the government could have enacted wholesale prohibition of th underlying conduct that it is permissible for the government to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct but reducing the demand through restrictions n advertisingemphasis by court clearly even had the court found the commonwealths restriction to fail th commercial speech standard it would have upheld the bar on the greaterincludes thelesser approach and the outlook for the sust aining of congressional regulation might be considered bright but posadas has not stood the test of time in 44 liquormart inc v rhode island 116 sct 1495 1 996 majority of the justices although in disparate separate opinions disavowed posadas both in it s applicat ion of the central hudson test and in its greaterincludesthelesser analysis at issue before t he court were two state laws prohibiting the advertising of the price of alcoholic beverages one banning all advertising by liquor licensees and outofstate manufacturers wholesalers and shippers outside of the license d premises and the other barring news media from publishing or broadcastin ghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98344crs13 advertisements making reference to the price of alcoholic beverages the purported purpose of the state was to prom ote temperance besides rejecting the contention of the state based on posadas that it could choose ban on advertising rather tha n counter speech the justices either explicitly in some instances or implicitly i n others rejected posadas in its expression of the greaterincludesthelesser id 151013 justice stevens joined on this point by justices kennedy thomas an d ginsburg id 152022 justice oconnor concurring joined by chief justic rehnquist and justices souter and breyer whether co ngress could validly impose cap on attorneys fees as condition of enacting the tobacco settlement presents problematic proposition even if th greaterpower doctrine is the one applied single issue bill such as s 1570 standing alone would not have the adva ntage of the doctrine moreover it is unclear to what xtent the revisions in the omnibus bills the changes worked in wha t congress would accept and enact see the amended s 1415 as repo rted by the senate committee on commerce would unsettle the approach even assuming however that t he eventual law would be acceptable to both the states and the tobacco companie s it remains unclear whether the court would apply the greaterpower doctrine to find valid the cap on attorneys fees or whether it would apply the unconstitutionalconditions doctrine to invalidate congressional cap in the final analysis the predilection of the court of the majority of the court respecting the value of the constitutional principle at issue speech in many of th cited cases or federalism in the present circumstance appears to determine whic h doctrine will be opted for
