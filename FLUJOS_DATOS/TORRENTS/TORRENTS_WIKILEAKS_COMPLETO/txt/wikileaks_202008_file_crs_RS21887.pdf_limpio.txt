representative of unit of employees without an election has been introduced in the past two congresses1 the employee free choice act efca or the act introduced in the 110th congress as hr 800 and s 1041 would amend the national labor relations act nlra to allow union certification based on signed employee authorizations provide process for the bargaining of an initial agreement and prescribe new penalties for certain unfair labor practices labor officials have indicated that the efca is the most important work well be doing because its key to succeeding on everything else 2 this report reviews the current process for selec ting bargaining representative under the nlra and discusses how the efca would alter that proc ess in addition the report discusses the other changes that have been proposed by the act some of these changes have been suggested in the past for example legislation that would have established process for the bargaining of an initial agreement has been introduced in every congress since the 105 th congress3 g23g151g146g152g151g561g5g142g155g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g25g146g157g145g152g158g157g561g7g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 the efca would amend the nlra to allow an individual or labor organization to be certified as the exclusive representative of bargaining unit without an election4 the act would require the national labor relations board the board to conduct an investigation whenever petition was filed by an employee or group of employees or any individual or labor organization acting in their behalf alleging that majority of employees in bargaining unit wish to be represented by an individual or labor organization for the pur pose of collective bargaining if the board found that majority of employees in the unit signed authorizations designating the individual or labor organization as their bargaining representative it would certify such individual or labor organization as the representative currently labor organization usually becomes the exclusive representative for bargaining unit following an election under existing law the board conducts an investigation following the filing of petition that alleges that substantial number of employees wish to be represented for collective bargaining and that the employer declines to recognize their representative as the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit5 to constitute substantial number of employees at least 30 percent of the employees must indicate support for representation6 representation hearing will be conducted if the parties cannot voluntarily resolve the details of an election7 based on the record of such hearing the board will direct an election by secret ballot and certify the results8 1 hr

authorizations from majority of employees in bargaining unit may request to be recognized voluntarily by an employer as the exclusive representative of employees in the unit few employers engage in such voluntary recognition9 in nlrb v gissel packing co the us supreme court confirmed that signed authorization cards from majority of employees could give rise to bargaining obligations under section 8a5 of the nlra10 section 8a5 indicates that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees subject to the provisions of section 9a of the nlra11 section 9a provides that representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining12 because section 9a refers to exclusive representatives designated or selected by majority of employees without specifying how the representatives must be chosen it was understood that the showing of majority support through signed authorization cards could give rise to duty to bargain however the gissel court also noted that an employer is not obligated to accept the authorization cards as proof of majority status and could insist on an election13 moreover the court maintained that an employer is not required to justify his insistence on an election by making his own investigation of employee sentiment or by providing affirmative reasons for doubting the majority status 14 in subsequent case linden lumber v nlrb the court further concluded that union with authorization cards purporting to represent majority of the employees which is denied recognition by the employer has the burden of invoking the boards election procedure15 labor organizations contend that employers decline voluntary recognition based on authorization cards because they want to discourage support for representation in the period before an election is held 16 during this period it is believed that employers often hire antiunion consultants terminate prounion employees and conduct captiveaudience meetings where employees are exposed to the employers views against representation17 proponents of the efca maintain that certification based on majority of signed authorizations would eliminate this misconduct however those who oppose this kind of certification express concern for unions possible use continued in the preceding twelvemonth period valid election shall have been held in addition an election will be denied for bargaining unit where such unit is already covered by valid collective bargaining agreement the socalled contract bar to an election operates when there is written bargaining agreement that has been properly signed by the parties is binding on the parties and is of definite duration 9 see stephen i schlossberg and judith scott

in addition to providing for union certification without an election the efca would amend the nlra to allow for the involvement of the federal mediation and conciliation service fmcs during the negotiation of an initial agreement following certification or recognition of labor organization 20 if after 90 days of bargaining or such additional period as the parties may agree upon the parties fail to reach an agreement the act would permit either party to notify the fmcs and request mediation if after 30 days from the date mediation was requested or such additional period agreed upon by the parties the fmcs was unable to bring the parties to agreement the fmcs could refer the dispute to an arbitration board that would render binding decision under existing law the fmcs may provide mediation and conciliation services upon its own motion or upon the request of one or more of the parties to the dispute whenever in its judgment such dispute threatens to cause substantial interruption of commerce21 where state or other conciliation services are available to the parties the fmcs is directed to avoid attempting to mediate disputes which would have only minor effect on interstate commerce22 existing law does not distinguish between initial agreements and other agreements negotiated by the parties moreover the nlra does not provide for the use of binding arbitration to resolve disputes proponents of the efca argue that legislation is needed to promote the prompt negotiation of initial collective bargaining agreements23 in 32 percent of all cases the employer and the union reportedly fail to reach agreement within the first two years following an election24 some observe however that the availability of binding arbitration under the efca would likely discourage support for the legislation from the business community under the act employers would be faced with the possibility of having to accept what they view as unfavorable terms and conditions by the arbitration board under existing law the employer does not have to accept such terms and conditions the employer may decline unfavorable proposals with the hope that the union may change its position to avert strike if binding arbitration was required the employer would lose that bargaining leverage g18g142g151g138g149g157g146g142g156g561g23g151g141g142g155g561g157g145g142g561g16g14g20g3g561 the

the employer were seeking representation by labor organization or during the period after labor organization was recognized as units exclusive representative but before the first collective bargaining agreement was executed the board would be permitted to award employee back pay and 2 times that amount as liquidated damages25 the efca would also impose civil penalty for certain willful and repeated unfair labor practices any employer who willfully and repeatedly interferes with restrains or coerces an em ployee in the exercise of his right to organize or b discriminates against an employee with respect to his hiring tenure or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in labor organization either while employees of the employer are eking representation by labor organization or during the period after labor organization has been recognized as units exclusive representative but before the first collective bargaining agreement has been executed would be subject to civil penalty not to exceed 20000 for each violation the exact amount of the penalty would be determined by the board based on the gravity of the unfair labor practice and its impact on the charging party on others seeking to exercise rights guaranteed by the nlra or on the public interest 26 under existing law the board may order any person committing an unfair labor practice to cease and desist from such misconduct27 the board may also take such affirmative action including reinstatement with back pay as will effectuate the policies of the nlra28 section 12 of the nlra provides that any person who willfully resists prevents impedes or interferes with any member of the board or any of its agents or agencies in the performance of their duties under the act shall be punished by fine of not more than 5000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both 29 however specific penalty currently exists for the kind of willful and repeated misconduct described in the efca
