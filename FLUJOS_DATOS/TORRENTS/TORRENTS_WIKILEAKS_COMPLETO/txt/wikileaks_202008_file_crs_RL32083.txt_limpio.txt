division congressional research service the library of congress federal student aid need analysis background and selected simplification issues summary federal need analysis system underlies the annual allocation of billions of dollars in student financial aid supported by title iv of the higher education act aid applicants provide detailed financial and other information on the free application for federal student aid fafsa used to determine the financial resources students and their families are expected to use to meet postsecondary education expenses the expected family contribution efc at issue is the systems complexity and the barrier it may pose for aideligible students particularly lowincome students two key simplification questions addressed in this report are how much of the data currently collected by the fafsa is used to determine the efc and eligibility for federal aid can the efc be calculated using fewer data nearly all of the financial information gathered by the fafsa is used to calculate efcs and determine federal aid eligibility or to support administration of federal aid programs the fafsa can be filed electronically or in paper format the paper version used by large number of filers is the primary focus of this analysis because it requires many filers to respond to broader array of questions the 2004 2005 paper version has 135 questions over twothirds are involved in calculating the efc determining federal student aid eligibility and determining federal student aid packaging about 4 are clearly unrelated to the federal need analysis process three basic efc estimation models constructed for this report examine the effects on the efc calculation of the three major categories of financial information utilized in need analysis base income information adjusted gross income agi additional income information to further adjust available income and asset information this modelbased analysis shows that base income data play the lead role in determining efcs the contributions of the additional income and asset information vary by population the analysis suggests that from technical ie mathematical standpoint it is probably feasible to explore ways in which the financial information utilized for federal need analysis and aid eligibility determinations could be streamlined without deviating dramatically from the efc values generated under the current system efforts to simplify the federal need analysis system are likely to be influenced significantly by several fundamental tensions the ability of the system to gather sufficient information to make relatively fine financial distinctions among families may be adversely affected by some simplifying steps the federal system is intended to support the awarding of federal state and institutional aid meaning that simplifying changes will be assessed by their impact on the awarding of aid from each source and given the billions of dollars and millions of individuals involved simplifying changes with even proportionately modest effects potentially involve hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of individuals this is background report and will

federal need analysis system underlies the annual allocation of billions of dollars nearly 69 billion in fy2004 in student financial aid supported by title iv of the higher education act hea pl 89329 as amended1 annually this system involves millions of current and potential students who apply for federal student aid by providing detailed financial and other information on the free application for federal student aid fafsa fafsa data are used in statutorily defined formulas to determine the amount of financial resources students and their families are expected to direct toward postsecondary education expenses the expected family contribution efc financial need for needbased federal student aid programs is determined by the efc and its relationship to students cost of attendance relying on the calculation of need financial aid administrators faas in postsecondary institutions package federal state and institutional aid for aid applicants as the congress deliberates over the reauthorization of the hea it is considering issues involving the federal need analysis system perennial issue has been the complexity of the system and concern that it poses barrier to aid for eligible students particularly lowincome students this report begins with brief discussion of the interest in need analysis simplification it then provides basic overview of the federal need analysis system and analyses of two issues related to simplification the data requirements of the fafsa and the contribution of key financial information to the efc calculation for each applicant the questions addressed respectively by these analyses are the following for what purposes are data collected on the fafsa are data collected that are unrelated to determining the efc and eligibility for and amount of federal aid is there evidence that students may be submitting some data unnecessarily 1 title iv of the hea authorizes the sources of generally available federal student aid pell grants stafford loans federal workstudy federal supplemental educational opportunity grants and federal perkins loans these last three sources of aid are known collectively as the campusbased student aid programs because financial aid administrators at participating educational institutions have discretion in awarding their institutions shares of funding from these programs similar flexibility is not afforded financial aid administrators in the pell grant or stafford loan programs crs2 to what extent do the various income and asset data used in calculating the efc actually influence the size of the efc can it be calculated using fewer data than at present this is background report and will not be updated separate report will be available shortly tracking legislative action on need analysis simplification interest in simplification interest in simplifying the need analysis process through which students apply for and secure federal student aid springs particularly from the belief that the complexity of the process poses barrier to college access particularly for low income students as the national dialogue on student financial aid convened by the college board recently reported evidence suggests that the degree of complication in applying for aid leads to reduced access especially for firstgeneration college students increased simplicity in our aid system would likely result in significant increases in enrollment rates for students from lowincome backgrounds2 the national dialogue called on the federal government to simplify the federal student aid application process economist thomas kane suggests that the multibillion dollar federal pell grant program fails to play its intended role of increasing enrollment rates of lowincome individuals in part because the need analysis process is difficult for students and families to navigate he writes the pell grant program requires remarkable foresight one has to fill out fafsa be assigned an expected family contribution and receive an award letter from school simply to learn how much federal aid is on offer3 if lowincome families in particular find the need analysis system problematic demographic trends offer little comfort to those concerned about access to postsecondary education these trends suggest that in the future an increasing proportion of the potential collegegoingpopulation will be lowincome4 2

pagination at httpwwwrussellsageorgspecial_interestsocialinequalityrevkane01pdf an overview of the need analysis process is provided later in this crs report 4 for discussion of the implications of these demographic trends on college access see advisory committee on student financial assistance access denied restoring the continued crs3 overview of need analysis and aid packaging the present federal need analysis system is the product of the 1992 reauthorization of the hea which combined two federal systems one then in use for the pell grant program the other used for campusbased aid and stafford loans into single need analysis system the congress intended this single simplified system using common application form the fafsa to be the sole basis to the greatest extent possible for the determination of need for federal state and institutional aid5 any need analysis process including the current federal one will be the product of numerous compromises and at times arbitrary decisions about such issues as who is responsible for contributing financially toward students college expenses how much families need to meet living expenses or to meet retirement needs and which income and asset resources can be tapped to pay college bills and to what extent further among the challenges is deciding where to strike the balance between system that is simple for students and families to navigate and understand and system that accurately and fully measures the breadth and availability of aid applicants financial resources this challenge is compounded for the federal need analysis system which as noted is intended to serve not only federal aid distribution but also the allocation of state and institutional aid to the extent that the federal efc calculations are accepted by faas as reasonable measure of financial contribution the fafsa and efc can function as the basis for aid packaging at all levels but if states or higher education institutions feel that the process does not adequately gauge available resources or determine an appropriate contribution they may supplement or diverge from the federal system in awarding their own state or institutional aid the following is simplified view of the need analysis and aid packaging process that underlies the awarding of federal student aid hea title iv part f delineates much of the process which is described below and depicted in figure 1 it begins with the fafsa through which basic financial and nonfinancial 4 continued nations commitment to equal educational opportunity feb 2001 in that report the advisory committee discounted the negative influence of the current process of applying for federal student aid arguing that it had been simplified and was not the barrier it once was rather its primary concern was that the level of federal student aid directed to low income students was inadequate to meet their needs 5 the intended broader reach of the application form is made clear in the statutory language mandating its development the secretary of education is charged with identifying the data items to be included in the application but these items are to be selected in consultation with states to assist in the awarding of state financial assistance hea section 483a1 the hea further specifies in case should the number of such data items be less than the number included on the form on the date of enactment of the higher education amendments of 1998 possibly the intension of the latter provision is to ensure that state student aidrelated data elements will continue to be included crs4 information is gathered from student although considered in more detail below the primary information reported on the fafsa includes data identifying the aid applicant financial information for the student and his or her family eg adjusted gross income agi nonfinancial information describing attributes of the student and family eg number of dependents in college information that will be used to determine eligibility for federal state or institutional aid eg whether or not the aid applicant has completed his or her first bachelors degree information that will be used to package student aid eg asking if aid applicants are willing to borrow or work in addition to receiving grant aid and disseminationrelated information eg names of schools to which fafsa data and the efc should be provided fafsa data are submitted to the socalled central processor an entity working under contract for the us department of education ed that calculates the aid applicants efc based on statutorily defined rules from the central processor the efc and other summary data are reported to faas and to the fafsa filer an faa is responsible for calculating the aid applicants cost of attendance coa and then determining financial need for hea title iv programs except the pell grant program financial need generally equals coa minus efc6 under the pell grant program need generally equals maximum annual pell grant being awarded minus efc at this juncture the faas role is to package financial aid for the aid applicant this package starts with the pell grant the federal foundation for student aid other aid such as campusbased funds state and institutional aid and stafford loans are added to create the students aid package the aid applicant is then notified concerning the composition of the financial aid package some of these calculations vary from faa to faa not only does the aid administrator have some discretion in the awarding of campusbased student aid but section 479a of the hea explicitly gives faas discretion to adjust on case by case basis the coa or the values of the items used to calculate the efc to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances the statute offers examples of these special circumstances such as the recent unemployment of family member where the faa might exercise this professional judgement if he or she chooses to do so 6 the actual calculation of need for these programs is more complicated than shown because the faa is to take into account other estimated financial assistance received by the aid applicant crs5 figure 1

award notification to student source crs analysis crs6 calculation of the efc before considering the data actually collected on the fafsa and its role in the determination of an aid applicants efc it is useful to have general understanding of how the efc is calculated dependency status one of the initial considerations in calculating the efc is determining whether the financial resources of students parents are to be considered parental financial resources are not considered in determining the efc if the student meets the statutory definition of an independent student that is if he or she meets any of the following conditions is 24 years of age or older is married is enrolled in graduate or professional program has dependent other than spouse is an orphan or ward of the court or was ward until age 18 or is military veteran importantly the efc calculation process differs for two kinds of independent students those independent students who have legal dependents other than perhaps spouse and those independent students who have legal dependents other than spouse this group is described in this report as independent students with children any applicant for federal needbased aid who does not meet one of the conditions listed above is automatically treated as dependent student for title iv aid purposes for such student information on parental resources must be submitted on the fafsa and will be used in calculating the efc steps in calculating the efc the process for calculating the annual efc is described in very general terms below this description applies to the 20042005 award year7 the efc for dependent student and his or her parents is determined by adding together an expected contribution from the parents and an expected contribution from the student 7 the description omits significant details ed has posted descriptions of the efc calculations for recent years at httpwwwifapedgovifapwebapp currentefcinformationpagjsp crs7 the parental contribution portion of the efc is computed as follows step 1 parents available income is calculated by determining total income agi8 plus certain untaxed income minus certain other income and financial benefits and then subtracting various allowances for such things as basic living expenses the socalled income protection allowance federal taxes and state and other taxes step 2 parents discretionary net worth is calculated by adding together cash savings net worth of investments net worth of businesses and farms but excluding the value of the family home or the family farm and then subtracting an allowance to protect assets needed for retirement future education and emergencies step 3 the contribution from available income and discretionary net worth is calculated by applying progressive assessment schedule with minimum assessment rate of 22 and maximum rate of 47 to the combined total of parents available income and 12 of discretionary net worth9 and then dividing the result by the number of college students in the family excluding the parents next the dependent students portion of the efc is determined as follows step 4 contribution from the dependent students income is calculated equal to 50 of his or her available income similar determination to that of parental available income although the income protection allowance is appreciably smaller for the dependent student step 5 contribution from the dependent students assets is determined equal to 35 of his or her own net worth unlike the parental calculation of discretionary net worth asset protection allowance is subtracted from the dependents net worth finally the total efc for the dependent student is determined as follows step 6 the parental contribution from available income and discretionary net worth see step 3 above is added to the dependent students contributions from income and from assets see steps 4 and 5 above for an independent student with children the calculation of the efc is identical to that for determining the parental contribution for dependent student steps 1 through 3 above for an independent student with dependents other than spouse if any the calculation of the efc is similar to that for determining the contributions from dependent students own income and assets steps 4 and 5 above the assessment 8 for aid filers who did not file federal income tax return income information included on their w2 forms is used instead of agi in the need analysis process 9 given the maximum rate of the assessment schedule not more than 564 of the parental discretionary net worth can be expected in contribution 12 47 564 crs8 rates applied to income and assets are the same the income protection allowances differ significantly unlike for the dependent student there is protection allowance applied to this independent students net worth of assets special efc conditions there are two major circumstances under which the efc calculation requires markedly less information from an aid applicant under the simplified needs test assets are considered in calculating the efc for dependent student if his or her parents agi is less than 50000 and the student and parents meet certain conditions applied to their tax returns10 similarly assets are not considered in determining the efc for an independent student if the agi of the student and spouse if any is less than 5000011 further there is an automatic zero efc that is the efc is automatically set to zero in the event dependent students parents or an independent student with children have agi that is not greater than 15000 the current maximum amount of income rounded to the nearest 1000 that one can earn and still be able to claim the maximum federal earned income tax credit12 the automatic zero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents fafsa this section analyzes the data collected on the fafsa and addresses questions related to how these data are used such as how many questions are asked of aid filers what the answers are used for to what extent are questions related to federal aid allocation and to what extent are they used solely for allocation of nonfederal aid the fafsa can be filed with the central processor electronically or in paper form the analysis below focuses primarily on the collection of data using the paper version of the 20042005 fafsa filed by new aid applicants because it appears to require filers to answer broader array of questions than the available electronic version13 despite significant growth in electronic filing of the fafsa large portion and number of filers continue to use the paper application according to ed data with much of the processing cycle for 20032004 completed about 18 million 10 to be eligible for the simplified needs test the student and his or her parents must not have to file an income return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez this requirement is also met if the parents or student file form 1040 if that form is filed only to claim the federal hope or lifetime learning tax credit 11 the tax formfiling requirements specified above must also be met by the independent student and spouse 12 the tax formfiling requirements specified for the simplified needs test must also be met 13 the paper and electronic versions of the 20042005 fafsa can be filed at anytime between jan 1 2004 and june 30 2005 crs9 new and renewal fafsas14 had been filed15 of the over 115 million new applications nearly 29 or over 33 million were submitted by aid applicants themselves on paper in addition of the remaining new applications submitted electronically about 17 million were filed by financial aid administrators on behalf of aid applicants for some of these applications financial aid administrators may have had the applicants fill out and sign paper fafsa the administrators then submit the fafsa data electronically16 number of questions and primary purposes the 20042005 paper fafsa has 135 questions this count differs from the numbered questions on the fafsa which go up to 103 it includes unnumbered questions appearing on fafsa worksheets b and c these worksheets used to gather information on additional sources of income to be added or subtracted from taxable income in the efc determination ask filers to answer 20 specific questions about their income and if they are dependent students to also answer the same 20 questions separately about their parents income as result 40 questions are considered to be generated by the worksheets further this count treats several clusters of questions as single questions aid applicants name ie last name first name middle initial permanent mailing address ie number and street city state and zip code drivers license ie license number and issuing state fatherstepfathers name ie last name and first initial and motherstepmothers name ie last name and first initial in table 1 the fafsa questions are divided into 10 different categories according to their primary purpose with an 11th category for the few questions whose use is unclear the determination of how responses to specific fafsa questions might be used was based on information contained in three publications from ed17 this table provides examples of the kinds of data requested by category and the number of fafsa questions falling into each category 14 typically students who have in prior year submitted an original fafsa are able to apply for aid in subsequent year with renewal fafsa which requests significantly less information 15 the latest data are available at httpifapedgoveannouncements0527applicreceivschbysource0405html 16 us department of education federal student aid handbook 20042005

income tax exemptions claimed for 2003 this information is not used in calculating the efc and the sources consulted to purpose is unclear 5 determine the purposes of various questions are silent regarding the use of this particular information source crs analysis crs12 findings in general most questions fall uniquely into one of these 11 categories with the first nine constituting those directly related to federal student aid need analysis for table 1 each question on the fafsa is counted only once even if it might have fallen into multiple categories any question that could be included not only in one of the first nine categories but also the 10th determination of eligibility for and aid from state and institutional aid programs is counted only in one of the initial nine categories as result the count of questions in the 10th category includes only those questions that do not also contribute to federal student aid need analysis based on table 1 it appears that 60 81 questions of the 135 questions are primarily involved in calculating applicants efcs either providing financial information or nonfinancial information over twothirds 93 questions are part of the cluster of questions involved in calculating the efc determining federal student aid eligibility and determining federal student aid packaging in contrast only about 4 six questions are clearly unrelated to the federal need analysis process falling into the 10th category questions of complexity relevant to the issue of simplification is whether the format and layout of the fafsa is unduly complex or whether the data sought by specific fafsa questions might be difficult for applicants to generate in general the former is beyond the scope of the present report with regard to the latter some comments are in order generally it would appear that most of the nonfinancial data requested would be relatively easy for applicants to provide eg name address and grade level at beginning of 20042005 school year of course issues may arise with wording of specific questions even if the information sought is straightforward many of the financial questions related to income are linked by the fafsa to specific lines in an aid applicants or parents federal income tax returns this presumably makes the provision of this information easier if the applicant has followed the advice in the fafsa instructions that he or she have completed federal income tax returns prior to filling out the fafsa two kinds of financial information requested on the fafsa may be difficult for some aid filers to generate asset information and the supplementary income information requested on the fafsa worksheets b or c potential difficulty with assets such as businesses investment farms or real estate other than home lived in by the aid filer is determining their net worth as requested by the fafsa although some of the supplementary income information sought on the worksheets is linked to specific lines on federal income tax forms eg earned income credit some is not eg welfare benefits and untaxed social security benefits the latter may not be easily generated by filers further several of the worksheet questions are openended for example on worksheet b filers are asked to delineate any other untaxed income or benefits not reported elsewhere on worksheets and b such as workers compensation untaxed portions of railroad retirement benefits black lung benefits disability etc due to their broad openended nature such questions may be particularly troubling for some fafsa filers crs13 not every question must be answered not every new fafsa filer is required to answer each of the 135 questions identified in this analysis18 regardless of whether they file paper or electronic versions of the fafsa independent students do not respond to the 47 questions concerning parental financial and nonfinancial information 27 of them are numbered questions on the fafsa and 20 are questions on worksheets b and c technically for federal aid allocations all questions concerning assets can be skipped by applicants eligible for the simplified needs tests under which assets are not considered in calculating the efc as can asset and some income questions by applicants eligible for the automatic zero efc but this option is available only to those who file on the web those filers are advised that they may ignore certain income or asset questions depending upon whether they meet the criteria for either of these special conditions for efc calculation although they are also informed that the separate determination of eligibility for state or institutional aid may require such data19 in contrast students who submit the paper fafsa are to answer all income and asset related questions regardless of whether they are eligible for the simplified needs test or the automatic zero efc the instructions for the paper fafsa do note that some applicants might be able to skip asset questions if they apply over the internet as result students who are unwilling or unable to file electronically eg they prefer not to transmit family financial information over the internet or they do not have access to the internet will be required to answer several questions that are unnecessary for determination of their efc and federal student aid some of these questions call for relatively complex financial information such as net worth of assets or information on various kinds of untaxed income20 how does the income and asset information collected on the fafsa contribute to the determination of the efc this section of the report considers the roles varied income and asset data collected by the fafsa play in determining the efcs of federal financial aid applicants the analysis presented in this section examines how the major categories of financial information used in need analysis influence efc calculations the 18 as noted earlier students submitting renewal fafsas are required to submit significantly less information 19 see presentation slides made available by ed in document entitled fafsa on the web for 20042005 at httpifapedgoveannouncementsattachments1024fotwscreenshotsattachppt 20 as noted the fafsa and efc calculations are intended to serve federal state and institutional aid programs as result for some fafsa filers this income and asset information may be necessary for determining eligibility for state and institutional aid although unnecessary for determining the efc crs14 findings from the analysis are discussed in light of questions that have arisen about whether the efc could be calculated using fewer data than at present the analysis upon which this section of the report is based utilizes data on federal financial aid applicants from the national postsecondary student aid study npsas21 npsas provides nationally representative data on sample of postsecondary students the analysis relies on series of npsasbased efc estimation models these models utilize fafsa data available through npsas to estimate the efcs that would be produced when certain broad categories of information are excluded from the need analysis process three basic estimation models have been constructed to produce three alternate estimates of efcs each model uses less information than is currently used in need analysis the modeled efcs produced through these estimation models are compared to actual efcs to shed light on the influence of the excluded information the analysis measures the extent to which efcs would change from those currently calculated it should be stressed that change in students efc might affect his or her eligibility for student aid but need not for example student may have such large efc that even with significant decline he or she would still be ineligible for needbased aid nevertheless for many students decline in the efc will spell greater need for needbased aid and potentially more awarded aid while an increase in the efc will reduce need and possibly reduce the amount of aid they will be awarded as has been noted three basic efc estimation models have been constructed they are designed to produce estimated efcs that can be used to examine the influence of the three major categories of financial information utilized in need analysis base income information agi additional income information extra income information gathered through fafsa worksheets which is used to further adjust ones available income and asset information each estimation model is described below model 1 this model substitutes agi for total income in the efc calculation it calculates efcs based solely on agi and asset contributions excluding the additional income information ie the information gathered through fafsa worksheets from consideration in need analysis model 2 this model excludes asset contributions from need analysis calculations it calculates efcs based solely on available income utilizing all income information model 3 this model substitutes agi for total income and excludes asset contributions in the calculation of the efc it essentially calculates an efc based exclusively on agi 21 the latest available npsas provides fafsa data for the 19992000 award year the fafsa for that year does not differ significantly from the 20042005 fafsa analyzed in the preceding section of this report crs15 each of the three models excludes certain information however in each of the models all other aspects of need analysis calculations ie the adjustments and allowances described earlier are unaltered the analyses presented in the pages that follow examine the modeled efcs in relation to the actual efcs to illuminate the effects of the excluded information the information in the tables below presents the findings of these analyses findings are reported for each of the aid populations treated separately in need analysis dependent students independent students without dependents and independent students with children table 2 presents results from regression analyses which illuminate the extent to which various types of income and asset information contribute to the efc calculation22 not surprisingly when all of the major categories of financial information are used as independent variables in regression model virtually all variance in efcs is explained explanatory percentages go down when financial information is eliminated ie when modeled efcs from estimation models 1 2 and 3 are used as independent variables the results from regression analysis presented below provide relative sense of the importance of categories of financial information which varies across need analysis populations the data presented in table 2 reflect the amount of variation explained when efcs produced by the estimation models using reduced information are examined in relation to actual efcs these data suggest that the additional worksheet income information used in need analysis accounts for roughly 8 of the variation in dependent students efcs ie 9235 of the variation in efcs is captured when the worksheet income information is excluded from need analysis under model 1 the worksheet income information accounts for roughly 7 and 11 of the variation in the efcs of independents without dependents and independents with children respectively the data presented in table 2 also suggest the asset information used in need analysis accounts for roughly 14 of the variation in dependent students efcs and 10 and 3 of the variation in the efcs of independents without dependents and independents with children respectively additionally table 2 suggests that taken together the asset information and the additional income information account for roughly 1519 of the variation in efcs across the populations 22 regression analysis is method of explaining or predicting the variability of dependent variable using information about one or more independent variables it attempts to answer the question what values in the dependent variable can we expect given certain values in the independent variables in the regression analyses presented in this report students actual efcs were used as the dependent variables the independent variables are the modeled efcs generated through estimation models 1 2 and 3 for each student students actual efcs are regressed against the modeled efcs which reflect the efcs students would receive if less information were used in need analysis calculations the figure reported on is the rsquared which shows how much of the variability of the actual efc is accounted for or explained by the modeled efc crs16 table 2 amount of variation in efcs for

the direction in which efcs move when need analysis calculations rely on reduced information this information is provided to further delineate how the broad categories of efc financial data affect efcs for purposes of the analyses presented in tables 3 and 4 modeled efcs with values within 100 of actual efcs were considered to be the same the data presented in table 3 indicate that for the great majority of aid applicants efcs are reduced or remain the same when the additional fafsa worksheet income information is eliminated from need analysis nonetheless notable subset of students ranging from 511 in each need analysis population is adversely affected having their efcs rise when additional income information is excluded from calculations ie they will have less need for aid23 the same general pattern is evident when the additional income information and asset contributions are collectively eliminated from need analysis when asset information is eliminated from need analysis and need analysis calculations are based exclusively on income information including worksheet data efcs either remain the same or are lowered students would be adversely affected24 23 this outcome some applicants being unaffected or benefitting efc falling while others are adversely affected efc rising is not unexpected given that the additional income information from fafsa worksheets is comprised of untaxed income which is added to aid applicants agi and protected income which is subtracted 24 this outcome is also not surprising efcs cannot actually increase when asset information is excluded from need analysis this is because asset information is added to income information and can only serve to elevate an efc or leave it unaltered crs17 table 3 estimated change in efc for

19992000 national postsecondary student aid study npsas 2000 data crs18 another noteworthy trend evident in the data displayed in table 3 pertains to the change in efc amounts as has been discussed consistently across each of the need analysis populations much larger percentages of aid applicants have efcs lowered as opposed to increased under each of the modeled scenarios the median shift in efc amounts also is consistently larger for those whose efcs are reduced as opposed to those facing larger efcs25 this suggests that broad reductions in the additional worksheet income information and asset information would likely have the net effect of increasing the receipt and cost of needbased aid table 4 presents information on aid applicants with incomes under 50000 this subpopulation is already treated as group whose need can be assessed using simplified formula it is also population for whom some suggest need analysis should be further simplified table 4 illustrates shifts in the directionality of efcs for this population when need analysis calculations rely on reduced information table 4 presents data on the estimated efcs produced for each need analysis population within this income category under each of the models table 4 reveals that across the need analysis populations within this income category efcs are lowered or remain the same for the great majority of students when the additional worksheet income information is removed from consideration nonetheless subset of students ranging from 49 in each need analysis population is adversely affected having their efcs rise when additional income information is excluded from calculations the same pattern is evident when the additional income information and asset contributions are collectively eliminated from need analysis when asset information is eliminated efcs remain the same or are lowered 25 the median is that value where 50 of applicants in category had higher change in value and 50 had lower

this income category changes in efc amounts are consistently larger for those whose efcs are lowered than for those whose efcs increase for this subpopulation similar to the full population of aid applicants the net effect of the broad reductions in efc financial data considered here would be increases in the receipt and cost of need based aid crs20 it is important to note that examining the effects of excluding this information from need analysis at relatively broad levels of aggregation potentially masks how its exclusion affects smaller subpopulations some of whom see their efcs rise when supplemental income information is excluded this is an important point because parties interested in considering simplification of need analysis are generally concerned about the effects simplification proposals will have on aid recipients to fully analyze this it is necessary to study the changes in efc values for all sub populations of interest particularly those who may end up adversely affected by simplifications this point is illustrated in table 5 which examines in greater detail changes in efcs of dependent students with incomes under 50000 whose efcs would increase by 500 or more under models 1 and 3 table 5 dependent students with incomes under 50000 whose estimated efcs increase by 500 or more when selected income and asset information is eliminated from need analysis percent of dependent students with incomes under median increase in efc 50000 whose efcs increase for those whose efc by 500 or more increases by 500 or more model 1 substitutes agi for 3 809 total income model 3 substitutes agi for total income and 2 905 eliminates asset contributions source crs analysis of 19992000 national postsecondary student aid study npsas 2000 data as table 5 shows roughly 3 of dependent students with incomes under 50000 fare considerably worse under the simplifications embodied in model 1 and 2 do so under model 3 put in different terms approximately 63000 dependent applicants in this income category would have their efcs increase by 500 or more under model 1 and roughly 50000 would under model 3 this adverse effect would be unacceptable to some while others might feel the benefits yielded by those whose efcs are reduced under these scenarios outweigh the costs associated with these simplifications under model 1 onethird of the students in this income category roughly 735000 have their efcs reduced and approximately 40 roughly 973000 have their efcs reduced under model 3 this is just one illustration many could have been considered but it shows the value of examining in some detail the effects of categories of information collected by the fafsa particularly if one is contemplating changes in need analysis of particular importance this example reveals the contribution of categories of information used in need analysis differs within subpopulations this also shows the type of tradeoffs likely to face decisionmakers crs21 summary comments in general the analyses presented in this section of the report show that the base income data ie agi play the lead role in determining efcs the contributions of the additional income information and asset information vary by population categorical reductions in information ie simplifications considered here primarily result in reduced or unaltered efcs which suggests that such changes could increase program costs but some changes could increase efcs meaning that some stakeholders could fare worse especially if income protections are eliminated the analysis presented here establishes basic parameters illuminating what broad categories of information collected by the fafsa contribute to need analysis calculations simplification proposals often suggest smaller scale reductions in information eg the elimination of few items as opposed to whole categories of information to understand the effects of such proposals other analyses would be required conclusion roughly 12 years ago the congress revamped the federal need analysis system by creating single simplified system featuring common application form and single methodology for determining the efc the congress sought to ensure that the federal need analysis would be used to the greatest extent possible for the determination of need for federal state and institutional aid questions regularly arise about whether the system can be further simplified this report considered two of the primary issues that surface with some regularity how much of the information currently collected by the fafsa is actually used to determine the efc and eligibility for federal aid can the efc be calculated using fewer data than at present the findings presented in this report suggest that nearly all of the financial information gathered through the fafsa form are used to calculate efcs and determine federal aid eligibility nevertheless some aid applicants who use the paper fafsa are required to file some financial data unnecessary for federal aid purposes at the same time the modeling presented in this report suggests that from technical ie mathematical standpoint it is probably feasible to explore ways in which the financial information utilized for federal need analysis and aid eligibility determinations could be streamlined without deviating dramatically from the efc values generated under the current system deliberation by education policymakers of the analysis presented here is likely to be influenced by several tensions inherent in the federal need analysis system among these tensions are the following for most students the fafsa seeks to gather sufficient information to make relatively fine distinctions among families in terms of their crs22 ability to pay for college simplifying the process and rendering it more transparent ie allowing families without much trouble to make reasonably accurate estimates of the amount of aid they will receive may make it harder to draw those distinctions the process is intended not only to serve in the awarding of federal aid but to the greatest extent possible be the single system used for state and institutional aid allocation as well as result changes must be assessed in terms of how they affect the systems ability to serve these multiple sources of aid changes that lead to an expansion of eligibility for aid will raise program costs changes that reduce program costs are likely to adversely affect eligibility given the magnitude of the amount of aid being awarded under this process and the number of students involved changes that may have proportionately only minor negative consequences for eligibility may affect significant numbers of students while proportionately minor effects on program costs may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32083
