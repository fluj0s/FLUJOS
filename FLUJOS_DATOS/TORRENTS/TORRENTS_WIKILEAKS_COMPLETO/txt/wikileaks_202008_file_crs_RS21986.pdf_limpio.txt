finance division april 17 2007 abstract the federal reserve fed the nations central bank has many duties its primary duty is the execution of monetary policy to fulﬁll its mandate to promote stable economic growth and low and stable price inﬂation this report focuses on one particular duty of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort to the nations ﬁnancial system since generalized ﬁnancial panics threaten economic stability the fed may at times be required to take actions to prevent panic to fulﬁll its mandate the lender of last resort function can be carried out by directly lending to speciﬁc banks through the discount window or more generally by lending to the ﬁnancial sector as whole through open market operations the sale and purchase of us treasury bonds to alter credit conditions this report concludes by describing some recent instances including september 11 where the fed acted in accordance with its lender of last resort functionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21986g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

federal reserve act 38 stat 251 today its primary duty is the execution of monetary policy through open market operations open market operations are carried out through the purchase and sale of us treasury securities in the secondary market in order to alter the reserves of the banking system by altering bank reserves the fed can influence shortterm interest rates and hence credit conditions to fulfill its mandate to promote stable economic growth and low and stable price inflation 1 besides the conduct of monetary policy the federal reserve has number of other duties it regulates financial institutions issues paper currency clears checks collects economic data and carries out economic research2 this report focuses on one particular responsibility to act as lender of last resort to the financial system to prevent financial panics as explained below the fed can carry out its lender of last resort duties directly by making discount loans to member banks or indirectly through open market operations g22g145g142g561g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g14g142g151g141g142g155g561g152g143g561g14g138g156g157g561g20g142g156g152g155g157g561 financial institutions are susceptible to two types of financial problems first an institution can become insolvent if its liabilities exceed its assets for financial institutions this is likely to be caused by decline in asset values for example when borrowers default on loans the loanswhich are assets to the banklose their value while the value of the deposits the bank used to finance these loans remain the same second an institution can become illiquid if creditors withdraw their funds more quickly than the in stitution can liquidate its assets to pay them 3 banks are particularly prone to this problem because of the maturity mismatch between assets long term loans and liabilities shortterm deposits for example depositors can withdraw funds from their checking accounts instantaneously but selling an illiquid asset such as loan at other than distressed prices takes time for that reason banks hold liquid reserves to account for typical fluctuations in account withdrawals but if withdrawals are large enough to exceed reserves liquidity crisis will ensue from its founding the role of lender of last resort has been central to the feds mission recurring financial panics of the 19 th century and in 1907 showed major structural weakness in the us financial system providing political impetus to create central bank ironically the fed did little to prevent the nations greatest financial panic 19301933 when more than 9000 banks failed as result of liquidity crisis in the absence of deposit insurance depositors knew that they could lose some or all of their deposits if they did not remove their funds before bank failed because of insufficient information about banks finances depositors could only guess if their bank was solvent or insolvent thus bank failures in many cases became selffulfilling prophecy if enough depositors suspected bank was insolventeven if it was healthya bank run would begin because its assets were illiquid even healthy bank would be unable to satisfy all withdrawals at this point the bank would be forced to close 1 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by gail makinen and marc labonte 2 summary of other issues related to the federal reserve can be found in crs report rs20949 the federal reserve recurrent public policy issues by marc labonte 3 liquid market is one where there are many buyers and sellers so that transaction costs are small and any one transaction has little effect on price adding liquidity to th financial system is more generic term that popularly refers to increasing the funds flowing through the financia l system it can be thought to correspond to the more technical concept of increasing the money supply t

g344g561there are two ways the government can prevent or mitigate bank panics the first is to take away the motivation for bank runs the depositors fear of losing his savings through deposit insurance4 classic bank run has not occurred since the establishment of deposit insurance in 1934 the second way is to offer banks way to swap illiquid assets for liquid assets the fed carries out this function through the operation of the discount window but the 19301933 banking crisis suggests that discount window that requires highquality collateral is not enough to avert bank panic financial panics can be more generalized than few institutions and not necessarily limited to the banking system the fed can use open market operations to increase the liquidity of the entire financial systemalthough this option cannot be targeted to specific institutions in trouble in this case the fed is not acting as lender of last resort for any particular institution rather it is acting more broadly to maintain the smooth functioning of the overall financial system g6g146g156g140g152g158g151g157g561g25g146g151g141g152g160g561g14g142g151g141g146g151g144g561 the discount window is the mechanism through which banks borrow directly from the federal reserve the fed limits discount window lending to banks with liquidity problemsit frowns upon banks using the discount window as regular source of financing5 shortterm loans are called primary credit and longerterm loans are called secondary credit all loans must be secured with acceptable collateral such as us treasury securities to prevent the fed from propping up insolvent banks with discount window lending undercapitalized banks can typically borrow from the discount window for maximum of only 60 days during any 120day period discount window lending to nonbank firms is legally possible in special circumstances but has not occurred since the 1930s discount window lending has the same effect on the economy as expansionary open market operationsby increasing the reserves of the banking system all else equal it reduces interest rates and provides shortterm boost to aggregate spending nevertheless open market operations dwarf discount window lending discoun t window loans typically average tens of millions of dollars per week 6 by comparison gross open market operations average in the hundreds of billions since the mid1980s primary credit previously called adjustment credit has been below 05 billion per year and below 02 billion since the early 1990s in recent years about 25 banks week borrowed from the discount window 7 in normal financial conditions banks can manage fluctuations in their reserves by borrowing or lending reserves in the federal funds market the interest rate in this private market the federal funds rate is the feds target for monetary policy banks are discouraged from turning to the discount window in normal conditions because the discount rate set by the fed is higher than the federal funds target rate until 2003 the discount rate had been set below the federal funds target 4 for more information on deposit insurance see crs report rl31552 deposit insurance the governments role and its implications for funding by gillian garcia available upon request 5 an exception is the seasonal credit program which is also operated through the discount window to help

g345g561rate and discount window borrowing under normal conditions had been discouraged by the fed through moral suasion there is special case where discount window lending may need to be extended to financial institutions that are essentially insolvent rather than illiquid this is the case of toobigtofail banks or banks whose closure would disrupt the smooth operation of the financial system as whole there is objective way to identify when an institution becomes too big to fail it can be argued that government regulators have purposely remained ambiguous in their own definition perhaps in the belief that ambiguity would disc ourage any firm from acting recklessly because it knew it would be bailed out if it failed the moral hazard problem the most famous example of the too big to fail doctrine was the 1984 resolution of the continental illinois crisis which was the nations seventh largest bank by assets at the time of its crisis continuing access to the discount window was one component of the governments resolution plana plan most remembered for the governments decision to fully compensate uninsured depositors 8 at times critics have called for discount window lending to be abolished although liquidity problems are legitimate the federal funds market offers banks market solution to liquidity problems if bank cannot convince the private sector to help it overcome liquidity problems one can argue that discount window lending represents subsidy from the federal government to bank that the market has deemed should fail the counterargument is that banks may be unable to tell if troubled bank is illiquid or insolvent and refuse to lend to it making the discount window necessary this potential for subsidy is cost that must be weighed against the benefit of more stable banking system that the discount window arguably provides g17g153g142g151g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 at times the threat to financial stability is not limited to few institutions but is spread throughout the financial system in these instances expansionary open market operations is the favored method for restoring calm open market operations allow the fed to inject essentially unlimited liquidity into the financial system as whole which offsets the private money flowing out of the financial system calm is then restored as sellers of financial instruments can again find buyers and vice versa this scenario is different from normal open market operations because in the absence of financial unrest the injection of liquidity would be incompatible with the feds mandate to provide price stability unlike discount window lending open market operations allow the fed to respond to financial crises in the nonbanking financial sector 9 limitation of this approach however is that the generalized nature of open market operations can be too blunt tool to neutralize more localized market problems theoretically the fed could intervene directly in the troubled market although in some instances this would require statutory changes but the fed declines to do so because many would view this as picking winners by c ontrast judicious use of the discount window is more politically acceptable when banking crisis is localized although in sense this could be seen as picking winners as well however the banking system is particularly susceptible to 8 federal deposit insurance corporation history of the eightieslessons for the future washington dec 1997 ch 7 9 discount window lending to nonbank institutions is

lender of last functions cannot easily be distinguished from normal monetary operations executed in the pursuit of stable economic conditions it can be difficult to identify specific instances when lender of last resort has been successful since successful lender of last resort is one that does not allow financial crises to occur because the united states has not suffered serious financial panic since the great depression the united states has either enjoyed very long streak of good luck or the lender of last resort has done very fine job indeed while identifying such events is admittedly ambiguous recent history nevertheless offers few good examples of occasions when financial crises would have been possible had it not been for the actions of the federal reserve the most recent and dramatic event in which the fed acted as lender of last resort was in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks to forestall any possibility of financial panic or break down in banking activity the federal reserve immediately issued simple 17 word statement the federal reserve system is open and operating the discount window is available to meet liquidity needs this immediately reassured the financial system that ample liquidity would be available on request without reprimand to supplement the liquidity sought by banks through the discount window the federal reserve bought large number of government securities through open market operations on the three days after the attack the federal reserve injected over 100 billion per day into the financial system thr ough discount window lending and open market operations 10 in addition the federal reserve entered into or expanded existing agreements with the european central bank the bank of canada and the bank of england to swap dollars for foreign currency in order to support foreign financial institutions operating in the united states on september 17 the day the new york stock exchange reopened the federal reserve lowered the key federal funds rates by 05 percentage points in the next three months it made three additional rate cuts bringing the federal funds target to 175 on december 11 2001 some other examples of episodes in which the lend er of last resort role was important were the y2k episode september 1998 11 and the stock market crash of october 1987 in all three of these examples economic growth was strong at the time of the intervention so the expansion of liquidity would not have been justified on usual grounds in all three cases the lender of last resort function was carried out primarily th rough open market operations discount window lending did not play an important role in any case while overall discount window lending rose slightly in 1987 and 19992000 the increase was not significant in the fall of 1998 discount window lending fell the reliance on open market operations may be due to the fact that these episodes did not directly involved the banking sector with the possible exception of they2k episode in that case the fed set up century date change special liquidity facility through the discount window from october 1999april 2000 but it was never widely used at its peak 10 see robert

of last resort functions are an invaluable duty of the federal reserve and one that cannot realistically be executed by any other governmental body since the fed controls the money supply while few would argue with the general necessity of lender of last resort some would question whether providing lender of last resort functions was appropriate in specific cases the fed has been vague and ambiguous about the criteria that guide its decision making in lender of last resort situations seemingly deciding on an ad hoc basis ambiguity may be necessary to prevent moral hazard on the part of the financial sector eg if banks were explicitly designated as too big to fail but it makes objective evaluation by outsiders difficult it is difficult to say whether the economy would have been better off if the fed had not acted since one cannot tell what might have been in the counterexample for example if the financial system could have rebounded on its own in september 1998 the feds intervention may have further inflated the stock market bubble causing additional damage to the economy when it eventually burst in 2001 since the economic costs of withholding lender of last resort functions exceed the costs of overproviding it is arguably appropriate to err on the side of caution as the fed seems to do
